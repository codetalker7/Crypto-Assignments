ONE FINE MORNING IN SPRING SOME TIME AFTER MARY AND CAROLINE WERE SETTLED IN THEIR NEW ABODE MRS MASON PROPOSED A WALK BEFORE BREAKFAST A CUSTOM SHE WISHED TO TEACH IMPERCEPTIBLY BY RENDERING IT AMUSING THE SUN HAD SCARCELY DISPELLED THE DEW THAT HUNG ON EVERY BLADE OF GRASS AND FILLED THE HALFSHUT FLOWERS EVERY PROSPECT SMILED AND THE FRESHNESS OF THE AIR CONVEYED THE MOST PLEASING SENSATIONS TO MRS MASONS MIND BUT THE CHILDREN WERE REGARDLESS OF THE SURROUNDING BEAUTIES AND RAN EAGERLY AFTER SOME INSECTS TO DESTROY THEM MRS MASON SILENTLY OBSERVED THEIR CRUEL SPORTS WITHOUT APPEARING TO DO IT BUT STEPPING SUDDENLY OUT OF THE FOOTPATH INTO THE LONG GRASS HER BUCKLE WAS CAUGHT IN IT AND STRIVING TO DISENTANGLE HERSELF SHE WET HER FEET WHICH THE CHILDREN KNEW SHE WISHED TO AVOID AS SHE HAD BEEN LATELY SICK THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ROUSED THEIR ATTENTION AND THEY FORGOT THEIR AMUSEMENT TO ENQUIRE WHY SHE HAD LEFT THE PATH AND MARY COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN A LAUGH WHEN SHE WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS TO AVOID TREADING ON SOME SNAILS THAT WERE CREEPING ACROSS THE NARROW FOOTWAY SURELY SAID MARY YOU DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANY HARM IN KILLING A SNAIL OR ANY OF THOSE NASTY CREATURES THAT CRAWL ON THE GROUND I HATE THEM AND SHOULD SCREAM IF ONE WAS TO FIND ITS WAY FROM MY CLOTHES TO MY NECK WITH GREAT GRAVITY MRS MASON ASKED HOW SHE DARED TO KILL ANY THING UNLESS IT WERE TO PREVENT ITS HURTING HER THEN RESUMING A SMILING FACE SHE SAID YOUR EDUCATION HAS BEEN NEGLECTED MY CHILD AS WE WALK ALONG ATTEND TO WHAT I SAY AND MAKE THE BEST ANSWERS YOU CAN AND DO YOU CAROLINE JOIN IN THE CONVERSATION YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD THAT GOD CREATED THE WORLD AND EVERY INHABITANT OF IT HE IS THEN CALLED THE FATHER OF ALL CREATURES AND ALL ARE MADE TO BE HAPPY WHOM A GOOD AND WISE GOD HAS CREATED HE MADE THOSE SNAILS YOU DESPISE AND CATERPILLARS AND SPIDERS AND WHEN HE MADE THEM DID NOT LEAVE THEM TO PERISH BUT PLACED THEM WHERE THE FOOD THAT IS MOST PROPER TO NOURISH THEM IS EASILY FOUND THEY DO NOT LIVE LONG BUT HE WHO IS THEIR FATHER AS WELL AS YOURS DIRECTS THEM TO DEPOSIT THEIR EGGS ON THE PLANTS THAT ARE FIT TO SUPPORT THEIR YOUNG WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GET FOOD FOR THEMSELVESAND WHEN SUCH A GREAT AND WISE BEING HAS TAKEN CARE TO PROVIDE EVERY THING NECESSARY FOR THE MEANEST CREATURE WOULD YOU DARE TO KILL IT MERELY BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO YOU UGLY MARY BEGAN TO BE ATTENTIVE AND QUICKLY FOLLOWED MRS MASONS EXAMPLE WHO ALLOWED A CATERPILLAR AND A SPIDER TO CREEP ON HER HAND YOU FIND THEM SHE REJOINED VERY HARMLESS BUT A GREAT NUMBER WOULD DESTROY OUR VEGETABLES AND FRUIT SO BIRDS ARE PERMITTED TO EAT THEM AS WE FEED ON ANIMALS AND IN SPRING THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER SEASON OF THE YEAR TO FURNISH FOOD FOR THE YOUNG BROODSHALFCONVINCED MARY SAID BUT WORMS ARE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IN THE WORLD YET REPLIED MRS MASON GOD CARES FOR THEM AND GIVES THEM EVERY THING THAT IS NECESSARY TO RENDER THEIR EXISTENCE COMFORTABLE YOU ARE OFTEN TROUBLESOMEI AM STRONGER THAN YOUYET I DO NOT KILL YOU OBSERVE THOSE ANTS THEY HAVE A LITTLE HABITATION IN YONDER HILLOCK THEY CARRY FOOD TO IT FOR THEIR YOUNG AND SLEEP VERY SNUG IN IT DURING THE COLD WEATHER THE BEES ALSO HAVE COMFORTABLE TOWNS AND LAY UP A STORE OF HONEY TO SUPPORT THEM WHEN THE FLOWERS DIE AND SNOW COVERS THE GROUND AND THIS FORECAST IS AS MUCH THE GIFT OF GOD AS ANY QUALITY YOU POSSESS DO YOU KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD GOODNESS I SEE YOU ARE UNWILLING TO ANSWER I WILL TELL YOU IT IS FIRST TO AVOID HURTING ANY THING AND THEN TO CONTRIVE TO GIVE AS MUCH PLEASURE AS YOU CAN IF SOME INSECTS ARE TO BE DESTROYED TO PRESERVE MY GARDEN FROM DESOLATION I HAVE IT DONE IN THE QUICKEST WAY THE DOMESTIC ANIMALS THAT I KEEP I PROVIDE THE BEST FOOD FOR AND NEVER SUFFER THEM TO BE TORMENTED AND THIS CAUTION ARISES FROM TWO MOTIVESI WISH TO MAKE THEM HAPPY AND AS I LOVE MY FELLOWCREATURES STILL BETTER THAN THE BRUTE CREATION I WOULD NOT ALLOW THOSE THAT I HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER TO GROW HABITUALLY THOUGHTLESS AND CRUEL TILL THEY WERE UNABLE TO RELISH THE GREATEST PLEASURE LIFE AFFORDSTHAT OF RESEMBLING GOD BY DOING GOOD A LARK NOW BEGAN TO SING AS IT SOARED ALOFT THE CHILDREN WATCHED ITS MOTIONS LISTENING TO THE ARTLESS MELODY THEY WONDERED WHAT IT WAS THINKING OFOF ITS YOUNG FAMILY THEY SOON CONCLUDED FOR IT FLEW OVER THE HEDGE AND DRAWING NEAR THEY HEARD THE YOUNG ONES CHIRP VERY SOON BOTH THE OLD BIRDS TOOK THEIR FLIGHT TOGETHER TO LOOK FOR FOOD TO SATISFY THE CRAVING OF THE ALMOST FLEDGED YOUNG AN IDLE BOY WHO HAD BORROWED A GUN FIRED AT THEMTHEY FELL AND BEFORE HE COULD TAKE UP THE WOUNDED PAIR HE PERCEIVED MRS MASON AND EXPECTING A VERY SEVERE REPRIMAND RAN AWAY SHE AND THE LITTLE GIRLS DREW NEAR AND FOUND THAT ONE WAS NOT MUCH HURT BUT THAT THE OTHER THE COCK HAD ONE LEG BROKEN AND BOTH ITS WINGS SHATTERED AND ITS LITTLE EYES SEEMED STARTING OUT OF THEIR SOCKETS IT WAS IN SUCH EXQUISITE PAIN THE CHILDREN TURNED AWAY THEIR EYES LOOK AT IT SAID MRS MASON DO YOU NOT SEE THAT IT SUFFERS AS MUCH AND MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU HAD THE SMALLPOX WHEN YOU WERE SO TENDERLY NURSED TAKE UP THE HEN I WILL BIND HER WING TOGETHER PERHAPS IT MAY HEAL AS TO THE COCK THOUGH I HATE TO KILL ANY THING I MUST PUT HIM OUT OF PAIN TO LEAVE HIM IN HIS PRESENT STATE WOULD BE CRUEL AND AVOIDING AN UNPLEASANT SENSATION MYSELF I SHOULD ALLOW THE POOR BIRD TO DIE BY INCHES AND CALL THIS TREATMENT TENDERNESS WHEN IT WOULD BE SELFISHNESS OR WEAKNESS SAYING SO SHE PUT HER FOOT ON THE BIRDS HEAD TURNING HER OWN ANOTHER WAY THEY WALKED ON WHEN CAROLINE REMARKED THAT THE NESTLINGS DEPRIVED OF THEIR PARENTS WOULD NOW PERISH AND THE MOTHER BEGAN TO FLUTTER IN HER HAND AS THEY DREW NEAR THE HEDGE THOUGH THE POOR CREATURE COULD NOT FLY YET SHE TRIED TO DO IT THE GIRLS WITH ONE VOICE BEGGED MRS MASON TO LET THEM TAKE THE NEST AND PROVIDE FOOD IN A CAGE AND SEE IF THE MOTHER COULD NOT CONTRIVE TO HOP ABOUT TO FEED THEM THE NEST AND THE OLD MOTHER WERE INSTANTLY IN MARYS HANDKERCHIEF A LITTLE OPENING WAS LEFT TO ADMIT THE AIR AND CAROLINE PEEPED INTO IT EVERY MOMENT TO SEE HOW THEY LOOKED I GIVE YOU LEAVE SAID MRS MASON TO TAKE THOSE BIRDS BECAUSE AN ACCIDENT HAS RENDERED THEM HELPLESS IF THAT HAD NOT BEEN THE CASE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONFINED THEY HAD SCARCELY REACHED THE NEXT FIELD WHEN THEY MET ANOTHER BOY WITH A NEST IN HIS HAND AND ON A TREE NEAR HIM SAW THE MOTHER WHO FORGETTING HER NATURAL TIMIDITY FOLLOWED THE SPOILER AND HER INTELLIGIBLE TONES OF ANGUISH REACHED THE EARS OF THE CHILDREN WHOSE HEARTS NOW FIRST FELT THE EMOTIONS OF HUMANITY CAROLINE CALLED HIM AND TAKING SIXPENCE OUT OF HER LITTLE PURSE OFFERED TO GIVE IT TO HIM FOR THE NEST IF HE WOULD SHEW HER WHERE HE HAD TAKEN IT FROM THE BOY CONSENTED AND AWAY RAN CAROLINE TO REPLACE ITCRYING ALL THE WAY HOW DELIGHTED THE OLD BIRD WILL BE TO FIND HER BROOD AGAIN THE PLEASURE THAT THE PARENTBIRD WOULD FEEL WAS TALKED OF TILL THEY CAME TO A LARGE COMMON AND HEARD SOME YOUNG ASSES AT THE DOOR OF AN HOVEL MAKING A MOST DREADFUL NOISE MRS MASON HAD ORDERED THE OLD ONES TO BE CONFINED LEST THE YOUNG SHOULD SUCK BEFORE THE NECESSARY QUANTITY HAD BEEN SAVED FOR SOME SICK PEOPLE IN HER NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN THE USUAL QUANTITY OF MILK THE THOUGHTLESS BOY HAD LEFT THEM STILL IN CONFINEMENT AND THE YOUNG IN VAIN IMPLORED THE FOOD NATURE DESIGNED FOR THEIR PARTICULAR SUPPORT OPEN THE HATCH SAID MRS MASON THE MOTHERS HAVE STILL ENOUGH LEFT TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG IT WAS OPENED AND THEY SAW THEM SUCK NOW SAID SHE WE WILL RETURN TO BREAKFAST GIVE ME YOUR HANDS MY LITTLE GIRLS YOU HAVE DONE GOOD THIS MORNING YOU HAVE ACTED LIKE RATIONAL CREATURES LOOK WHAT A FINE MORNING IT IS INSECTS BIRDS AND ANIMALS ARE ALL ENJOYING THIS SWEET DAY THANK GOD FOR PERMITTING YOU TO SEE IT AND FOR GIVING YOU AN UNDERSTANDING WHICH TEACHES YOU THAT YOU OUGHT BY DOING GOOD TO IMITATE HIM OTHER CREATURES ONLY THINK OF SUPPORTING THEMSELVES BUT MAN IS ALLOWED TO ENNOBLE HIS NATURE BY CULTIVATING HIS MIND AND ENLARGING HIS HEART HE FEELS DISINTERESTED LOVE EVERY PART OF THE CREATION AFFORDS AN EXERCISE FOR VIRTUE AND VIRTUE IS EVER THE TRUEST SOURCE OF PLEASURE CHAP II THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALSTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND MANPARENTAL AFFECTION OF A DOGBRUTALITY PUNISHED AFTER BREAKFAST MRS MASON GAVE THE CHILDREN MRS TRIMMERS FABULOUS HISTORIES AND THE SUBJECT STILL TURNED ON ANIMALS AND THE WANTON CRUELTY OF THOSE WHO TREATED THEM IMPROPERLY THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE EAGER TO EXPRESS THEIR DETESTATION AND REQUESTED THAT IN FUTURE THEY MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO FEED THE CHICKENS MRS MASON COMPLIED WITH THEIR REQUEST ONLY ONE CONDITION WAS ANNEXED TO THE PERMISSION THAT THEY DID IT REGULARLY WHEN YOU WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD YOU LEARN PATIENCE SHE ADDED AND YOU CAN MENTION YOUR WANTS BUT THOSE HELPLESS CREATURES CANNOT COMPLAIN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE FREQUENTLY SAYHOW CAN YOU TREAT A POOR DUMB BEAST ILL AND A STRESS IS VERY PROPERLY LAID ON THE WORD DUMB FOR DUMB THEY APPEAR TO THOSE WHO DO NOT OBSERVE THEIR LOOKS AND GESTURES BUT GOD WHO TAKES CARE OF EVERY THING UNDERSTANDS THEIR LANGUAGE AND SO DID CAROLINE THIS MORNING WHEN SHE RAN WITH SUCH EAGERNESS TO REPLACE THE NEST WHICH THE THOUGHTLESS BOY HAD STOLEN HEEDLESS OF THE MOTHERS AGONIZING CRIES MARY INTERRUPTED HER TO ASK IF INSECTS AND ANIMALS WERE NOT INFERIOR TO MEN CERTAINLY ANSWERED MRS MASON AND MEN ARE INFERIOR TO ANGELS YET WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE EXALTED BEINGS DELIGHT TO DO US GOOD YOU HAVE HEARD IN A BOOK WHICH I SELDOM PERMIT YOU TO READ BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT OF AN AGE TO UNDERSTAND IT THAT ANGELS WHEN THEY SANG GLORY TO GOD ON HIGH WISHED FOR PEACE ON EARTH AS A PROOF OF THE GOODWILL THEY FELT TOWARDS MEN AND ALL THE GLAD TIDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO MEN ANGELS HAVE PROCLAIMED INDEED THE WORD ANGEL SIGNIFIES A MESSENGER IN ORDER TO PLEASE GOD AND OUR HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON PLEASING HIM WE MUST DO GOOD WHAT WE CALL VIRTUE MAY BE THUS EXPLAINEDWE EXERCISE EVERY BENEVOLENT AFFECTION TO ENJOY COMFORT HERE AND TO FIT OURSELVES TO BE ANGELS HEREAFTER AND WHEN WE HAVE ACQUIRED HUMAN VIRTUES WE SHALL HAVE A NOBLER EMPLOYMENT IN OUR FATHERS KINGDOM BUT BETWEEN ANGELS AND MEN A MUCH GREATER RESEMBLANCE SUBSISTS THAN BETWEEN MEN AND THE BRUTE CREATION BECAUSE THE TWO FORMER SEEM CAPABLE OF IMPROVEMENT THE BIRDS YOU SAW TODAY DO NOT IMPROVEOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT ONLY TENDS TO SELFPRESERVATION THE FIRST NEST THEY MAKE AND THE LAST ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THOUGH IN THEIR FLIGHTS THEY MUST SEE MANY OTHERS MORE BEAUTIFUL IF NOT MORE CONVENIENT AND HAD THEY REASON THEY WOULD PROBABLY SHEW SOMETHING LIKE INDIVIDUAL TASTE IN THE FORM OF THEIR DWELLINGS BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE YOU SAW THE HEN TEAR THE DOWN FROM HER BREAST TO MAKE A NEST FOR HER EGGS YOU SAW HER BEAT THE GRAIN WITH HER BILL AND NOT SWALLOW A BIT TILL THE YOUNG WERE SATISFIED AND AFTERWARDS SHE COVERED THEM WITH HER WINGS AND SEEMED PERFECTLY HAPPY WHILE SHE WATCHED OVER HER CHARGE IF ANY ONE APPROACHED SHE WAS READY TO DEFEND THEM AT THE HAZARD OF HER LIFE YET A FORTNIGHT HENCE YOU WILL SEE THE SAME HEN DRIVE THE FLEDGED CHICKENS FROM THE CORN AND FORGET THE FONDNESS THAT SEEMED TO BE STRONGER THAN THE FIRST IMPULSE OF NATURE ANIMALS HAVE NOT THE AFFECTIONS WHICH ARISE FROM REASON NOR CAN THEY DO GOOD OR ACQUIRE VIRTUE EVERY AFFECTION AND IMPULSE WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED IN THEM ARE LIKE OUR INFERIOR EMOTIONS WHICH DO NOT DEPEND ENTIRELY ON OUR WILL BUT ARE INVOLUNTARY THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN IMPLANTED TO PRESERVE THE SPECIES AND MAKE THE INDIVIDUAL GRATEFUL FOR ACTUAL KINDNESS IF YOU CARESS AND FEED THEM THEY WILL LOVE YOU AS CHILDREN DO WITHOUT KNOWING WHY BUT WE NEITHER SEE IMAGINATION NOR WISDOM IN THEM AND WHAT PRINCIPALLY EXALTS MAN FRIENDSHIP AND DEVOTION THEY SEEM INCAPABLE OF FORMING THE LEAST IDEA OF FRIENDSHIP IS FOUNDED ON KNOWLEDGE AND VIRTUE AND THESE ARE HUMAN ACQUIREMENTS AND DEVOTION IS A PREPARATION FOR ETERNITY BECAUSE WHEN WE PRAY TO GOD WE OFFER AN AFFRONT TO HIM IF WE DO NOT STRIVE TO IMITATE THE PERFECTIONS HE DISPLAYS EVERY WHERE FOR OUR IMITATION THAT WE MAY GROW BETTER AND HAPPIER THE CHILDREN EAGERLY ENQUIRED IN WHAT MANNER THEY WERE TO BEHAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO ANIMALS THE ANSWER WAS SHORTBE TENDERHEARTED AND LET YOUR SUPERIOR ENDOWMENTS WARD OFF THE EVILS WHICH THEY CANNOT FORESEE IT IS ONLY TO ANIMALS THAT CHILDREN CAN DO GOOD MEN ARE THEIR SUPERIORS WHEN I WAS A CHILD ADDED THEIR TENDER FRIEND I ALWAYS MADE IT MY STUDY AND DELIGHT TO FEED ALL THE DUMB FAMILY THAT SURROUNDED OUR HOUSE AND WHEN I COULD BE OF USE TO ANY ONE OF THEM I WAS HAPPY THIS EMPLOYMENT HUMANIZED MY HEART WHILE LIKE WAX IT TOOK EVERY IMPRESSION AND PROVIDENCE HAS SINCE MADE ME AN INSTRUMENT OF GOODI HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO MY FELLOWCREATURES I WHO NEVER WANTONLY TROD ON AN INSECT OR DISREGARDED THE PLAINT OF THE SPEECHLESS BEAST CAN NOW GIVE BREAD TO THE HUNGRY PHYSIC TO THE SICK COMFORT TO THE AFFLICTED AND ABOVE ALL AM PREPARING YOU WHO ARE TO LIVE FOR EVER TO BE FIT FOR THE SOCIETY OF ANGELS AND GOOD MEN MADE PERFECT THIS WORLD I TOLD YOU WAS A ROAD TO A BETTERA PREPARATION FOR IT IF WE SUFFER WE GROW HUMBLER AND WISER BUT ANIMALS HAVE NOT THIS ADVANTAGE AND MAN SHOULD NOT PREVENT THEIR ENJOYING AT THE HAPPINESS OF WHICH THEY ARE CAPABLE A SHECAT OR DOG HAVE SUCH STRONG PARENTAL AFFECTION THAT IF YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR YOUNG IT ALMOST KILLS THEM SOME HAVE ACTUALLY DIED OF GRIEF WHEN ALL HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY THOUGH THEY DO NOT SEEM TO MISS THE GREATEST PART A BITCH HAD ONCE ALL HER LITTER STOLEN FROM HER AND DROWNED IN A NEIGHBOURING BROOK SHE SOUGHT THEM OUT AND BROUGHT THEM ONE BY ONE LAID THEM AT THE FEET OF HER CRUEL MASTERAND LOOKING WISTFULLY AT THEM FOR SOME TIME IN DUMB ANGUISH TURNING HER EYES ON THE DESTROYER SHE EXPIRED I MYSELF KNEW A MAN WHO HAD HARDENED HIS HEART TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE FOUND PLEASURE IN TORMENTING EVERY CREATURE WHOM HE HAD ANY POWER OVER I SAW HIM LET TWO GUINEAPIGS ROLL DOWN SLOPING TILES TO SEE IF THE FALL WOULD KILL THEM AND WERE THEY KILLED CRIED CAROLINE CERTAINLY AND IT IS WELL THEY WERE OR HE WOULD HAVE FOUND SOME OTHER MODE OF TORMENT WHEN HE BECAME A FATHER HE NOT ONLY NEGLECTED TO EDUCATE HIS CHILDREN AND SET THEM A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT HE TAUGHT THEM TO BE CRUEL WHILE HE TORMENTED THEM THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THEY NEGLECTED HIM WHEN HE WAS OLD AND FEEBLE AND HE DIED IN A DITCH YOU MAY NOW GO AND FEED YOUR BIRDS AND TIE SOME OF THE STRAGGLING FLOWERS ROUND THE GARDEN STICKS AFTER DINNER IF THE WEATHER CONTINUES FINE WE WILL WALK TO THE WOOD AND I WILL SHEW YOU THE HOLE IN THE LIMESTONE MOUNTAIN A MOUNTAIN WHOSE BOWELS AS WE CALL THEM ARE LIMESTONES IN WHICH POOR CRAZY ROBIN AND HIS DOG LIVED CHAP III THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALSTHE STORY OF CRAZY ROBINTHE MAN CONFINED IN THE BASTILLE IN THE AFTERNOON THE CHILDREN BOUNDED OVER THE SHORT GRASS OF THE COMMON AND WALKED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAIN TILL THEY CAME TO A CRAGGY PART WHERE A STREAM BROKE OUT AND RAN DOWN THE DECLIVITY STRUGGLING WITH THE HUGE STONES WHICH IMPEDED ITS PROGRESS AND OCCASIONED A NOISE THAT DID NOT UNPLEASANTLY INTERRUPT THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THE PLACE THE BROOK WAS SOON LOST IN A NEIGHBOURING WOOD AND THE CHILDREN TURNED THEIR EYES TO THE BROKEN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN OVER WHICH IVY GREW IN GREAT PROFUSION MRS MASON POINTED OUT A LITTLE CAVE AND DESIRED THEM TO SIT DOWN ON SOME STUMPS OF TREES WHILST SHE RELATED THE PROMISED STORY IN YONDER CAVE ONCE LIVED A POOR MAN WHO GENERALLY WENT BY THE NAME OF CRAZY ROBIN IN HIS YOUTH HE WAS VERY INDUSTRIOUS AND MARRIED MY FATHERS DAIRYMAID A GIRL DESERVING OF SUCH A GOOD HUSBAND FOR SOME TIME THEY CONTINUED TO LIVE VERY COMFORTABLY THEIR DAILY LABOUR PROCURED THEIR DAILY BREAD BUT ROBIN FINDING IT WAS LIKELY HE SHOULD HAVE A LARGE FAMILY BORROWED A TRIFLE TO ADD TO THE SMALL PITTANCE WHICH THEY HAD SAVED IN SERVICE AND TOOK A LITTLE FARM IN A NEIGHBOURING COUNTY I WAS THEN A CHILD TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AFTER I HEARD THAT A CRAZY MAN WHO APPEARED VERY HARMLESS HAD PILED BY THE SIDE OF THE BROOK A GREAT NUMBER OF STONES HE WOULD WADE INTO THE RIVER FOR THEM FOLLOWED BY A CUR DOG WHOM HE WOULD FREQUENTLY CALL HIS JACKY AND EVEN HIS NANCY AND THEN MUMBLE TO HIMSELFTHOU WILT NOT LEAVE MEWE WILL DWELL WITH THE OWLS IN THE IVYA NUMBER OF OWLS HAD TAKEN SHELTER IN IT THE STONES WHICH HE WADED FOR HE CARRIED TO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE AND ONLY JUST LEFT ROOM ENOUGH TO CREEP IN SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AT LAST RECOLLECTED HIS FACE AND I SENT TO ENQUIRE WHAT MISFORTUNE HAD REDUCED HIM TO SUCH A DEPLORABLE STATE THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED FROM DIFFERENT PERSONS I WILL COMMUNICATE TO YOU IN AS FEW WORDS AS I CAN SEVERAL OF HIS CHILDREN DIED IN THEIR INFANCY AND TWO YEARS BEFORE HE CAME TO HIS NATIVE PLACE ONE MISFORTUNE HAD FOLLOWED ANOTHER TILL HE HAD SUNK UNDER THEIR ACCUMULATED WEIGHT THROUGH VARIOUS ACCIDENTS HE WAS LONG IN ARREARS TO HIS LANDLORD WHO SEEING THAT HE WAS AN HONEST MAN WHO ENDEAVOURED TO BRING UP HIS FAMILY DID NOT DISTRESS HIM BUT WHEN HIS WIFE WAS LYINGIN OF HER LAST CHILD THE LANDLORD DYING HIS HEIR SENT AND SEIZED THE STOCK FOR THE RENT AND THE PERSON FROM WHOM HE HAD BORROWED SOME MONEY EXASPERATED TO SEE ALL GONE ARRESTING HIM IMMEDIATELY HE WAS HURRIED TO GAOL WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE ANY MONEY FOR HIS FAMILY THE POOR WOMAN COULD NOT SEE THEM STARVE AND TRYING TO SUPPORT HER CHILDREN BEFORE SHE HAD GAINED SUFFICIENT STRENGTH SHE CAUGHT COLD AND THROUGH NEGLECT AND HER WANT OF PROPER NOURISHMENT HER ILLNESS TURNED TO A PUTRID FEVER WHICH TWO OF THE CHILDREN CAUGHT FROM HER AND DIED WITH HER THE TWO WHO WERE LEFT JACKY AND NANCY WENT TO THEIR FATHER AND TOOK WITH THEM A CUR DOG THAT HAD LONG SHARED THEIR FRUGAL MEALS THE CHILDREN BEGGED IN THE DAY AND AT NIGHT SLEPT WITH THEIR WRETCHED FATHER POVERTY AND DIRT SOON ROBBED THEIR CHEEKS OF THE ROSES WHICH THE COUNTRY AIR MADE BLOOM WITH A PECULIAR FRESHNESS SO THAT THEY SOON CAUGHT A JAIL FEVERAND DIED THE POOR FATHER WHO WAS NOW BEREFT OF ALL HIS CHILDREN HUNG OVER THEIR BED IN SPEECHLESS ANGUISH NOT A GROAN OR A TEAR ESCAPED FROM HIM WHILST HE STOOD TWO OR THREE HOURS IN THE SAME ATTITUDE LOOKING AT THE DEAD BODIES OF HIS LITTLE DARLINGS THE DOG LICKED HIS HANDS AND STROVE TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION BUT FOR AWHILE HE SEEMED NOT TO OBSERVE HIS CARESSES WHEN HE DID HE SAID MOURNFULLY THOU WILT NOT LEAVE MEAND THEN HE BEGAN TO LAUGH THE BODIES WERE REMOVED AND HE REMAINED IN AN UNSETTLED STATE OFTEN FRANTIC AT LENGTH THE PHRENZY SUBSIDED AND HE GREW MELANCHOLY AND HARMLESS HE WAS NOT THEN SO CLOSELY WATCHED AND ONE DAY HE CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE THE DOG FOLLOWED HIM AND CAME DIRECTLY TO HIS NATIVE VILLAGE AFTER I HAD RECEIVED THIS ACCOUNT I DETERMINED HE SHOULD LIVE IN THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN UNDISTURBED I SENT SOME CONVENIENCES ALL OF WHICH HE REJECTED EXCEPT A MAT ON WHICH HE SOMETIMES SLEPTTHE DOG ALWAYS DID I TRIED TO INDUCE HIM TO EAT BUT HE CONSTANTLY GAVE THE DOG WHATEVER I SENT HIM AND LIVED ON HAWS AND BLACKBERRIES AND EVERY KIND OF TRASH I USED TO CALL FREQUENTLY ON HIM AND HE SOMETIMES FOLLOWED ME TO THE HOUSE I NOW LIVE IN AND IN WINTER HE WOULD COME OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND TAKE A CRUST OF BREAD HE GATHERED WATERCRESSES OUT OF THE POOL AND WOULD BRING THEM TO ME WITH NOSEGAYS OF WILD THYME WHICH HE PLUCKED FROM THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THE DOG WAS A CUR IT HAD INDEED THE BAD TRICK OF A CUR AND WOULD RUN BARKING AFTER HORSES HEELS ONE DAY WHEN HIS MASTER WAS GATHERING WATERCRESSES THE DOG RUNNING AFTER A YOUNG GENTLEMANS HORSE MADE IT START AND ALMOST THREW THE RIDER WHO GREW SO ANGRY THAT THOUGH HE KNEW IT WAS THE POOR MADMANS DOG HE LEVELLED HIS GUN AT HIS HEADSHOT HIMAND INSTANTLY RODE OFF ROBIN RAN TO HIS DOGHE LOOKED AT HIS WOUNDS AND NOT SENSIBLE THAT HE WAS DEAD CALLED TO HIM TO FOLLOW HIM BUT WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT HE TOOK HIM TO THE POOL AND WASHED OFF THE BLOOD BEFORE IT BEGAN TO CLOT AND THEN BROUGHT HIM HOME AND LAID HIM ON THE MAT I OBSERVED THAT I HAD NOT SEEN HIM PACING UP THE HILLS AS USUAL AND SENT TO ENQUIRE ABOUT HIM HE WAS FOUND SITTING BY THE DOG AND NO ENTREATIES COULD PREVAIL ON HIM TO QUIT THE BODY OR RECEIVE ANY REFRESHMENT I INSTANTLY SET OFF FOR THIS PLACE HOPING AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A FAVOURITE THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO EAT SOMETHING BUT WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND THE HAND OF DEATH WAS UPON HIM HE WAS STILL MELANCHOLY YET THERE WAS NOT SUCH A MIXTURE OF WILDNESS IN IT AS FORMERLY I PRESSED HIM TO TAKE SOME FOOD BUT INSTEAD OF ANSWERING ME OR TURNING AWAY HE BURST INTO TEARSA THING I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM DO BEFORE AND SOBBING HE SAID WILL ANY ONE BE KIND TO MEYOU WILL KILL MEI SAW NOT MY WIFE DIENO THEY DRAGGED ME FROM HERBUT I SAW JACKY AND NANCY DIEAND WHO PITIED MEBUT MY DOG HE TURNED HIS EYES TO THE BODYI WEPT WITH HIM HE WOULD THEN HAVE TAKEN SOME NOURISHMENT BUT NATURE WAS EXHAUSTEDAND HE EXPIRED WAS THAT THE CAVE SAID MARY THEY RAN TO IT POOR ROBIN DID YOU EVER HEAR OF ANY THING SO CRUEL YES ANSWERED MRS MASON AND AS WE WALK HOME I WILL RELATE AN INSTANCE OF STILL GREATER BARBARITY I TOLD YOU THAT ROBIN WAS CONFINED IN A JAIL IN FRANCE THEY HAVE A DREADFUL ONE CALLED THE BASTILLE THE POOR WRETCHES WHO ARE CONFINED IN IT LIVE ENTIRELY ALONE WHO HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF SEEING MEN OR ANIMALS NOR ARE THEY ALLOWED BOOKS THEY LIVE IN COMFORTLESS SOLITUDE SOME HAVE AMUSED THEMSELVES BY MAKING FIGURES ON THE WALL AND OTHERS HAVE LAID STRAWS IN ROWS ONE MISERABLE CAPTIVE FOUND A SPIDER HE NOURISHED IT FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS IT GREW TAME AND PARTOOK OF HIS LONELY MEAL THE KEEPER OBSERVED IT AND MENTIONED THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO A SUPERIOR WHO ORDERED HIM TO CRUSH IT IN VAIN DID THE MAN BEG TO HAVE HIS SPIDER SPARED YOU FIND MARY THAT THE NASTY CREATURE WHICH YOU DESPISED WAS COMFORT IN SOLITUDE THE KEEPER OBEYED THE CRUEL COMMAND AND THE UNHAPPY WRETCH FELT MORE PAIN WHEN HE HEARD THE CRUSH THAN HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED DURING HIS LONG CONFINEMENT HE LOOKED ROUND A DREARY APARTMENT AND THE SMALL PORTION OF LIGHT WHICH THE GRATED BARS ADMITTED ONLY SERVED TO SHEW HIM THAT HE BREATHED WHERE NOTHING ELSE DREW BREATH CHAP IV ANGERHISTORY OF JANE FRETFUL A FEW DAYS AFTER THESE WALKS AND CONVERSATIONS MRS MASON HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE PLAYROOM SHE RAN HASTILY TO ENQUIRE THE CAUSE AND FOUND THE CHILDREN CRYING AND NEAR THEM ONE OF THE YOUNG BIRDS LYING ON THE FLOOR DEAD WITH GREAT EAGERNESS EACH OF THEM TRIED THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED TO EXCULPATE HERSELF AND PROVE THAT THE OTHER HAD KILLED THE BIRD MRS MASON COMMANDED THEM TO BE SILENT AND AT THE SAME TIME CALLED AN ORPHAN WHOM SHE HAD EDUCATED AND DESIRED HER TO TAKE CARE OF THE NEST THE CAUSE OF THE DISPUTE WAS EASILY GATHERED FROM WHAT THEY BOTH LET FALL THEY HAD CONTESTED WHICH HAD THE BEST RIGHT TO FEED THE BIRDS MARY INSISTED THAT SHE HAD A RIGHT BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ELDEST AND CAROLINE BECAUSE SHE TOOK THE NEST SNATCHING IT FROM ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER THE BIRD FELL AND WAS TRODDEN ON BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE WHEN THEY WERE A LITTLE COMPOSED MRS MASON CALMLY THUS ADDRESSED THEM I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE ASHAMED OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR AND SORRY FOR THE CONSEQUENCE I WILL NOT THEREFORE SEVERELY REPROVE YOU NOR ADD BITTERNESS TO THE SELFREPROACH YOU MUST BOTH FEEL BECAUSE I PITY YOU YOU ARE NOW INFERIOR TO THE ANIMALS THAT GRAZE ON THE COMMON REASON ONLY SERVES TO RENDER YOUR FOLLY MORE CONSPICUOUS AND INEXCUSABLE ANGER IS A LITTLE DESPICABLE VICE ITS SELFISH EMOTIONS BANISH COMPASSION AND UNDERMINE EVERY VIRTUE IT IS EASY TO CONQUER ANOTHER BUT NOBLE TO SUBDUE ONES SELF HAD YOU MARY GIVEN WAY TO YOUR SISTERS HUMOUR YOU WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT YOU WERE NOT ONLY OLDER BUT WISER THAN HER AND YOU CAROLINE WOULD HAVE SAVED YOUR CHARGE IF YOU HAD FOR THE TIME WAVED YOUR RIGHT IT IS ALWAYS A PROOF OF SUPERIOR SENSE TO BEAR WITH SLIGHT INCONVENIENCES AND EVEN TRIFLING INJURIES WITHOUT COMPLAINING OR CONTESTING ABOUT THEM THE SOUL RESERVES ITS FIRMNESS FOR GREAT OCCASIONS AND THEN IT ACTS A DECIDED PART IT IS JUST THE CONTRARY MODE OF THINKING AND THE CONDUCT PRODUCED BY IT WHICH OCCASIONS ALL THOSE TRIVIAL DISPUTES THAT SLOWLY CORRODE DOMESTIC PEACE AND INSENSIBLY DESTROY WHAT GREAT MISFORTUNES COULD NOT SWEEP AWAY I WILL TELL YOU A STORY THAT WILL TAKE STRONGER HOLD ON YOUR MEMORY THAN MERE REMARKS JANE FRETFUL WAS AN ONLY CHILD HER FOND WEAK MOTHER WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO BE CONTRADICTED ON ANY OCCASION THE CHILD HAD SOME TENDERNESS OF HEART BUT SO ACCUSTOMED WAS SHE TO SEE EVERY THING GIVE WAY TO HER HUMOUR THAT SHE IMAGINED THE WORLD WAS ONLY MADE FOR HER IF ANY OF HER PLAYFELLOWS HAD TOYS THAT STRUCK HER CAPRICIOUS SICKLY FANCY SHE WOULD CRY FOR THEM AND SUBSTITUTES WERE IN VAIN OFFERED TO QUIET HER SHE MUST HAVE THE IDENTICAL ONES OR FLY INTO THE MOST VIOLENT PASSION WHEN SHE WAS AN INFANT IF SHE FELL DOWN HER NURSE MADE HER BEAT THE FLOOR SHE CONTINUED THE PRACTICE AFTERWARDS AND WHEN SHE WAS ANGRY WOULD KICK THE CHAIRS AND TABLES OR ANY SENSELESS PIECE OF FURNITURE IF THEY CAME IN HER WAY I HAVE SEEN HER THROW HER CAP INTO THE FIRE BECAUSE SOME OF HER ACQUAINTANCE HAD A PRETTIER CONTINUAL PASSIONS WEAKENED HER CONSTITUTION BESIDE SHE WOULD NOT EAT THE COMMON WHOLESOME FOOD THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE SMALLPOX AND WORMS OUGHT TO EAT AND WHICH IS NECESSARY WHEN THEY GROW SO FAST TO MAKE THEM STRONG AND HANDSOME INSTEAD OF BEING A COMFORT TO HER TENDER THOUGH MISTAKEN MOTHER SHE WAS HER GREATEST TORMENT THE SERVANTS ALL DISLIKED HER SHE LOVED NO ONE BUT HERSELF AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS SHE NEVER INSPIRED LOVE EVEN THE PITY GOODNATURED PEOPLE FELT WAS NEARLY ALLIED TO CONTEMPT A LADY WHO VISITED HER MOTHER BROUGHT WITH HER ONE DAY A PRETTY LITTLE DOG JANE WAS DELIGHTED WITH IT AND THE LADY WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE PARTED WITH IT TO OBLIGE HER FRIEND FOR SOME TIME SHE FONDLED AND REALLY FELT SOMETHING LIKE AN AFFECTION FOR IT BUT ONE DAY IT HAPPENED TO SNATCH A CAKE SHE WAS GOING TO EAT AND THOUGH THERE WERE TWENTY WITHIN REACH SHE FLEW INTO A VIOLENT PASSION AND THREW A STOOL AT THE POOR CREATURE WHO WAS BIG WITH PUP IT FELL DOWNI CAN SCARCELY TELL THE RESTIT RECEIVED SO SEVERE A BLOW THAT ALL THE YOUNG WERE KILLED AND THE POOR WRETCH LANGUISHED TWO DAYS SUFFERING THE MOST EXCRUCIATING TORTURE JANE FRETFUL WHO WAS NOW ANGRY WITH HERSELF SAT ALL THE TIME HOLDING IT AND EVERY LOOK THE MISERABLE ANIMAL GAVE HER STUNG HER TO THE HEART AFTER ITS DEATH SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY BUT DID NOT TRY TO CONQUER HER TEMPER ALL THE BLESSINGS OF LIFE WERE THROWN AWAY ON HER AND WITHOUT ANY REAL MISFORTUNE SHE WAS CONTINUALLY MISERABLE IF SHE HAD PLANNED A PARTY OF PLEASURE AND THE WEATHER PROVED UNFAVOURABLE THE WHOLE DAY WAS SPENT IN FRUITLESS REPINING OR VENTING HER ILLHUMOUR ON THOSE WHO DEPENDED ON HER IF NO DISAPPOINTMENT OF THAT KIND OCCURRED SHE COULD NOT ENJOY THE PROMISED PLEASURE SOMETHING ALWAYS DISCONCERTED HER THE HORSES WENT TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW THE DINNER WAS ILLDRESSED OR SOME OF THE COMPANY CONTRADICTED HER SHE WAS WHEN A CHILD VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT ANGER SOON DISTORTED HER REGULAR FEATURES AND GAVE A FORBIDDING FIERCENESS TO HER EYES BUT IF FOR A MOMENT SHE LOOKED PLEASED SHE STILL RESEMBLED A HEAP OF COMBUSTIBLE MATTER TO WHICH AN ACCIDENTAL SPARK MIGHT SET FIRE OF COURSE QUIET PEOPLE WERE AFRAID TO CONVERSE WITH HER AND IF SHE EVER DID A GOOD OR A HUMANE ACTION HER RIDICULOUS ANGER SOON RENDERED IT AN INTOLERABLE BURDEN IF IT DID NOT ENTIRELY CANCEL IT AT LAST SHE BROKE HER MOTHERS HEART OR HASTENED HER DEATH BY HER WANT OF DUTY AND HER MANY OTHER FAULTS ALL PROCEEDING FROM VIOLENT UNRESTRAINED ANGER THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER WHICH AFFECTED HER VERY MUCH LEFT HER WITHOUT A FRIEND SHE WOULD SOMETIMES SAY AH MY POOR MOTHER IF YOU WERE NOW ALIVE I WOULD NOT TEAZE YOUI WOULD GIVE THE WORLD TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM SORRY FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE YOU DIED THINKING ME UNGRATEFUL AND LAMENTING THAT I DID NOT DIE WHEN YOU GAVE ME SUCK I SHALL NEVEROH NEVER SEE YOU MORE THIS THOUGHT AND HER PEEVISH TEMPER PREYED ON HER IMPAIRED CONSTITUTION SHE HAD NOT BY DOING GOOD PREPARED HER SOUL FOR ANOTHER STATE OR CHERISHED ANY HOPES THAT COULD DISARM DEATH OF ITS TERRORS OR RENDER THAT LAST SLEEP SWEETITS APPROACH WAS DREADFULAND SHE HASTENED HER END SCOLDING THE PHYSICIAN FOR NOT CURING HER HER LIFELESS COUNTENANCE DISPLAYED THE MARKS OF CONVULSIVE ANGER AND SHE LEFT AN AMPLE FORTUNE BEHIND HER TO THOSE WHO DID NOT REGRET HER LOSS THEY FOLLOWED HER TO THE GRAVE ON WHICH NO ONE SHED A TEAR SHE WAS SOON FORGOTTEN AND I ONLY REMEMBER HER TO WARN YOU TO SHUN HER ERRORS CHAP V LYINGHONOURTRUTHSMALL DUTIESHISTORY OF LADY SLY AND MRS TRUEMAN THE LITTLE GIRLS WERE VERY ASSIDUOUS TO GAIN MRS MASONS GOOD OPINION AND BY THE MILDNESS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR TO PROVE TO HER THAT THEY WERE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES IT WAS ONE OF MRS MASONS RULES WHEN THEY OFFENDED HER THAT IS BEHAVED IMPROPERLY TO TREAT THEM CIVILLY BUT TO AVOID GIVING THEM THOSE MARKS OF AFFECTION WHICH THEY WERE PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE YESTERDAY SAID SHE TO THEM I ONLY MENTIONED TO YOU ONE FAULT THOUGH I OBSERVED TWO YOU VERY READILY GUESS I MEAN THE LIE THAT YOU BOTH TOLD NAY LOOK UP FOR I WISH TO SEE YOU BLUSH AND THE CONFUSION WHICH I PERCEIVE IN YOUR FACES GIVES ME PLEASURE BECAUSE IT CONVINCES ME THAT IT IS NOT A CONFIRMED HABIT AND INDEED MY CHILDREN I SHOULD BE SORRY THAT SUCH A MEAN ONE HAD TAKEN DEEP ROOT IN YOUR INFANT MINDS WHEN I SPEAK OF FALSEHOOD I MEAN EVERY KIND WHATEVER TENDS TO DECEIVE THOUGH NOT SAID IN DIRECT TERMS TONES OF VOICE MOTIONS OF THE HAND OR HEAD IF THEY MAKE ANOTHER BELIEVE WHAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO BELIEVE ARE LIES AND OF THE WORST KIND BECAUSE THE CONTRIVANCE AGGRAVATES THE GUILT I WOULD MUCH SOONER FORGIVE A LIE TOLD DIRECTLY WHEN PERHAPS FEAR ENTIRELY OCCUPIED THE THOUGHTS AND THE PRESENCE OF GOD WAS NOT FELT FOR IT IS HIS SACRED MAJESTY THAT YOU AFFRONT BY TELLING AN UNTRUTH HOW SO ENQUIRED MARY BECAUSE YOU HOPE TO CONCEAL YOUR FALSEHOOD FROM EVERY HUMAN CREATURE BUT IF YOU CONSIDER A MOMENT YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT THE SEARCHER OF HEARTS READS YOUR VERY THOUGHTS THAT NOTHING IS HID FROM HIM YOU WOULD BLUSH IF I WERE TO DISCOVER THAT YOU TOLD A LIE YET WANTONLY FORFEIT THE FAVOUR OF HIM FROM WHOM YOU HAVE RECEIVED LIFE AND ALL ITS BLESSINGS TO SCREEN YOURSELVES FROM CORRECTION OR REPROOF OR WHAT IS STILL WORSE TO PURCHASE SOME TRIFLING GRATIFICATION THE PLEASURE OF WHICH WOULD LAST BUT A MOMENT YOU HEARD THE GENTLEMAN WHO VISITED ME THIS MORNING VERY FREQUENTLY USE THE WORD HONOUR HONOUR CONSISTS IN RESPECTING YOURSELF IN DOING AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY AND THE FOUNDATION OF HONOUR IS TRUTH WHEN I CAN DEPEND ON THE VERACITY OF PEOPLE THAT IS TO SAY AM CONVINCED THAT THEY ADHERE TO TRUTH I RELY ON THEM AM CERTAIN THEY HAVE COURAGE BECAUSE I KNOW THEY WILL BEAR ANY INCONVENIENCE RATHER THAN DESPISE THEMSELVES FOR TELLING A LIE BESIDES IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHAT YOU INTEND TO SAY WHEN YOU HAVE DONE RIGHT ALWAYS DETERMINE ON EVERY OCCASION TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND YOU WILL NEVER BE AT A LOSS FOR WORDS IF YOUR CHARACTER FOR THIS SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION IS ONCE FIXED YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WILL BE COURTED AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH YOU WILL AT LEAST RESPECT YOUR HONOURABLE PRINCIPLES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM A FRIENDSHIP WITHOUT MAKING TRUTH THE BASIS IT IS INDEED THE ESSENCE OF DEVOTION THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE SUPPORT OF EVERY DUTY I GOVERN MY SERVANTS AND YOU BY ATTENDING STRICTLY TO TRUTH AND THIS OBSERVANCE KEEPING MY HEAD CLEAR AND MY HEART PURE I AM EVER READY TO PRAY TO THE AUTHOR OF GOOD THE FOUNTAIN OF TRUTH WHILE I AM DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT LET ME POINT OUT TO YOU ANOTHER BRANCH OF THIS VIRTUE SINCERITYAND REMEMBER THAT I EVERY DAY SET YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR I NEVER TO PLEASE FOR THE MOMENT PAY UNMEANING COMPLIMENTS OR PERMIT ANY WORDS TO DROP FROM MY TONGUE THAT MY HEART DOES NOT DICTATE AND WHEN I RELATE ANY MATTER OF FACT I CAREFULLY AVOID EMBELLISHING IT IN ORDER TO RENDER IT A MORE ENTERTAINING STORY NOT THAT I THINK SUCH A PRACTICE ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL BUT AS IT CONTRIBUTES INSENSIBLY TO WEAR AWAY A RESPECT FOR TRUTH I GUARD AGAINST THE VAIN IMPULSE LEST I SHOULD LOSE THE CHIEF STRENGTH AND EVEN ORNAMENT OF MY MIND AND BECOME LIKE A WAVE OF THE SEA DRIFTED ABOUT BY EVERY GUST OF PASSION YOU MUST IN LIFE OBSERVE THE MOST APPARENTLY INSIGNIFICANT DUTIESTHE GREAT ONES ARE THE PILLARS OF VIRTUE BUT THE CONSTANT CONCURRENCE OF TRIFLING THINGS MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT REASON AND CONSCIENCE SHOULD ALWAYS PRESIDE TO KEEP THE HEART STEADY MANY PEOPLE MAKE PROMISES AND APPOINTMENTS WHICH THEY SCRUPLE NOT TO BREAK IF A MORE INVITING PLEASURE OCCURS NOT REMEMBERING THAT THE SLIGHTEST DUTY SHOULD BE PERFORMED BEFORE A MERE AMUSEMENT IS PURSUEDFOR ANY NEGLECT OF THIS KIND EMBITTERS PLAY NOTHING BELIEVE ME CAN LONG BE PLEASANT THAT IS NOT INNOCENT AS I USUALLY ENDEAVOUR TO RECOLLECT SOME PERSONS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAVE SUFFERED BY THE FAULTS OR FOLLIES I WISH YOU TO AVOID I WILL DESCRIBE TWO CHARACTERS THAT WILL IF I MISTAKE NOT VERY STRONGLY ENFORCE WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING LAST WEEK YOU SAW LADY SLY WHO CAME TO PAY ME A MORNING VISIT DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A FINE CARRIAGE OR SUCH BEAUTIFUL HORSES HOW THEY PAWED THE GROUND AND DISPLAYED THEIR RICH HARNESSES HER SERVANTS WORE ELEGANT LIVERIES AND HER OWN CLOTHES SUITED THE EQUIPAGE HER HOUSE IS EQUAL TO HER CARRIAGE THE ROOMS ARE LOFTY AND HUNG WITH SILK NOBLE GLASSES AND PICTURES ADORN THEM AND THE PLEASUREGROUNDS ARE LARGE AND WELL LAID OUT BESIDE THE TREES AND SHRUBS THEY CONTAIN A VARIETY OF SUMMERHOUSES AND TEMPLES AS THEY ARE CALLED YET MY YOUNG FRIENDS THIS IS STATE NOT DIGNITY THIS WOMAN HAS A LITTLE SOUL SHE NEVER ATTENDED TO TRUTH AND OBTAINING GREAT PART OF HER FORTUNE BY FALSEHOOD IT HAS BLIGHTED ALL HER ENJOYMENTS SHE INHABITS THAT SUPERB HOUSE WEARS THE GAYEST CLOTHES AND RIDES IN THAT BEAUTIFUL CARRIAGE WITHOUT FEELING PLEASURE SUSPICION AND THE CARES IT HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO HAVE WRINKLED HER COUNTENANCE AND BANISHED EVERY TRACE OF BEAUTY WHICH PAINT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURS TO REPAIR HER SUSPICIOUS TEMPER ARISES FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF HER OWN HEART AND THE WANT OF RATIONAL EMPLOYMENTS SHE IMAGINES THAT EVERY PERSON SHE CONVERSES WITH MEANS TO DECEIVE HER AND WHEN SHE LEAVES A COMPANY SUPPOSES ALL THE ILL THEY MAY SAY OF HER BECAUSE SHE RECOLLECTS HER OWN PRACTICE SHE LISTENS ABOUT HER HOUSE EXPECTING TO DISCOVER THE DESIGNS OF HER SERVANTS NONE OF WHOM SHE CAN TRUST AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ANXIETY HER SLEEP IS UNSOUND AND HER FOOD TASTELESS SHE WALKS IN HER PARADISE OF A GARDEN AND SMELLS NOT THE FLOWERS NOR DO THE BIRDS INSPIRE HER WITH CHEARFULNESSTHESE PLEASURES ARE TRUE AND SIMPLE THEY LEAD TO THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THE CREATURES WHOM HE HATH MADEAND CANNOT WARM A HEART WHICH A MALICIOUS STORY CAN PLEASE SHE CANNOT PRAY TO GODHE HATES A LIAR SHE IS NEGLECTED BY HER HUSBAND WHOSE ONLY MOTIVE FOR MARRYING HER WAS TO CLEAR AN INCUMBERED ESTATE HER SON HER ONLY CHILD IS UNDUTIFUL THE POOR NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO BLESS HER NOR DOES SHE CONTRIBUTE TO THE HAPPINESS OF ANY HUMAN BEING TO KILL TIME AND DRIVE AWAY THE PANGS OF REMORSE SHE GOES FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER COLLECTING AND PROPAGATING SCANDALOUS TALES TO BRING OTHERS ON A LEVEL WITH HERSELF EVEN THOSE WHO RESEMBLE HER ARE AFRAID OF HER SHE LIVES ALONE IN THE WORLD ITS GOOD THINGS ARE POISONED BY HER VICES AND NEITHER INSPIRE JOY NOR GRATITUDE BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW SHE ACQUIRED THESE VICIOUS HABITS AND ENLARGED HER FORTUNE BY DISREGARDING TRUTH I MUST DESIRE YOU TO THINK OF MRS TRUEMAN THE CURATES WIFE WHO LIVES IN YONDER WHITE HOUSE CLOSE TO THE CHURCH IT IS A SMALL ONE YET THE WOODBINES AND JESSAMINS THAT TWINE ABOUT THE WINDOWS GIVE IT A PRETTY APPEARANCE HER VOICE IS SWEET HER MANNERS NOT ONLY EASY BUT ELEGANT AND HER SIMPLE DRESS MAKES HER PERSON APPEAR TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE SHE WALKS TO VISIT ME AND HER LITTLE ONES HANG ON HER HANDS AND CLING TO HER CLOTHES THEY ARE SO FOND OF HER IF ANY THING TERRIFIES THEM THEY RUN UNDER HER APRON AND SHE LOOKS LIKE THE HEN TAKING CARE OF HER YOUNG BROOD THE DOMESTIC ANIMALS PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN FINDING HER A MILD ATTENTIVE MISTRESS AND OUT OF HER SCANTY FORTUNE SHE CONTRIVES TO FEED AND CLOTHE MANY A HUNGRY SHIVERING WRETCH WHO BLESS HER AS SHE PASSES ALONG THOUGH SHE HAS NOT ANY OUTWARD DECORATIONS SHE APPEARS SUPERIOR TO HER NEIGHBOURS WHO CALL HER THE GENTLEWOMAN INDEED EVERY GESTURE SHEWS AN ACCOMPLISHED AND DIGNIFIED MIND THAT RELIES ON ITSELF WHEN DEPRIVED OF THE FORTUNE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO POLISH AND GIVE IT CONSEQUENCE DRAWINGS THE AMUSEMENT OF HER YOUTH ORNAMENT HER NEAT PARLOUR SOME MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS STAND IN ONE CORNER FOR SHE PLAYS WITH TASTE AND SINGS SWEETLY ALL THE FURNITURE NOT FORGETTING A BOOKCASE FULL OF WELLCHOSEN BOOKS SPEAK THE REFINEMENT OF THE OWNER AND THE PLEASURES A CULTIVATED MIND HAS WITHIN ITS OWN GRASP INDEPENDENT OF PROSPERITY HER HUSBAND A MAN OF TASTE AND LEARNING READS TO HER WHILE SHE MAKES CLOTHES FOR HER CHILDREN WHOM SHE TEACHES IN THE TENDEREST AND MOST PERSUASIVE MANNER IMPORTANT TRUTHS AND ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE BEHAVED WELL FOR SOME TIME YOU SHALL VISIT HER AND RAMBLE IN HER LITTLE GARDEN THERE ARE SEVERAL PRETTY SEATS IN IT AND THE NIGHTINGALES WARBLE THEIR SWEETEST SONGS UNDISTURBED IN THE SHADE I HAVE NOW GIVEN YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE PRESENT SITUATION OF BOTH AND OF THEIR CHARACTERS LISTEN TO ME WHILST I RELATE IN WHAT MANNER THESE CHARACTERS WERE FORMED AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF EACH ADHERING TO A DIFFERENT MODE OF CONDUCT LADY SLY WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD USED TO SAY PERT THINGS WHICH THE INJUDICIOUS PEOPLE ABOUT HER LAUGHED AT AND CALLED VERY WITTY FINDING THAT HER PRATTLE PLEASED SHE TALKED INCESSANTLY AND INVENTED STORIES WHEN ADDING TO THOSE THAT HAD SOME FOUNDATION WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENTERTAIN THE COMPANY IF SHE STOLE SWEETMEATS OR BROKE ANY THING THE CAT OR THE DOG WAS BLAMED AND THE POOR ANIMALS WERE CORRECTED FOR HER FAULTS NAY SOMETIMES THE SERVANTS LOST THEIR PLACES IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER ASSERTIONS HER PARENTS DIED AND LEFT HER A LARGE FORTUNE AND AN AUNT WHO HAD A STILL LARGER ADOPTED HER MRS TRUEMAN HER COUSIN WAS SOME YEARS AFTER ADOPTED BY THE SAME LADY BUT HER PARENTS COULD NOT LEAVE THEIR ESTATE TO HER AS IT DESCENDED TO THE MALE HEIR SHE HAD RECEIVED THE MOST LIBERAL EDUCATION AND WAS IN EVERY RESPECT THE REVERSE OF HER COUSIN WHO ENVIED HER MERIT AND COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK OF HER DIVIDING THE FORTUNE WHICH SHE HAD LONG EXPECTED TO INHERIT ENTIRELY HERSELF SHE THEREFORE PRACTISED EVERY MEAN ART TO PREJUDICE HER AUNT AGAINST HER AND SUCCEEDED A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT ENDEAVOURED TO OPEN HER MISTRESSS EYES BUT THE CUNNING NIECE CONTRIVED TO INVENT THE MOST INFAMOUS STORY OF THE OLD DOMESTIC WHO WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF IT DISMISSED MRS TRUEMAN SUPPORTED HER WHEN SHE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN VINDICATING HER AND SUFFERED FOR HER GENEROSITY FOR HER AUNT DYING SOON AFTER LEFT ONLY FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO THIS AMIABLE WOMAN AND FIFTY THOUSAND TO LADY SLY THEY BOTH OF THEM MARRIED SHORTLY AFTER ONE THE PROFLIGATE LORD SLY AND THE OTHER A RESPECTABLE CLERGYMAN WHO HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN HIS HOPES OF PREFERMENT THIS LAST COUPLE IN SPITE OF THEIR MUTUAL DISAPPOINTMENTS ARE CONTENTED WITH THEIR LOT AND ARE PREPARING THEMSELVES AND CHILDREN FOR ANOTHER WORLD WHERE TRUTH VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS DWELL TOGETHER FOR BELIEVE ME WHATEVER HAPPINESS WE ATTAIN IN THIS LIFE MUST FAINTLY RESEMBLE WHAT GOD HIMSELF ENJOYS WHOSE TRUTH AND GOODNESS PRODUCE A SUBLIME DEGREE SUCH AS WE CANNOT CONCEIVE IT IS SO FAR ABOVE OUR LIMITED CAPACITIES I DID NOT INTEND TO DETAIN YOU SO LONG SAID MRS MASON HAVE YOU FINISHED MRS TRIMMERS FABULOUS HISTORIES INDEED WE HAVE ANSWERED CAROLINE MOURNFULLY AND I WAS VERY SORRY TO COME TO THE END I NEVER READ SUCH A PRETTY BOOK MAY I READ IT OVER AGAIN TO MRS TRUEMANS LITTLE FANNY CERTAINLY SAID MRS MASON IF YOU CAN MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT BIRDS NEVER TALK GO AND RUN ABOUT THE GARDEN AND REMEMBER THE NEXT LIE I DETECT I SHALL PUNISH BECAUSE LYING IS A VICE AND I OUGHT TO PUNISH YOU IF YOU ARE GUILTY OF IT TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING LADY SLYS MISERY CHAP VI ANGERFOLLY PRODUCES SELFCONTEMPT AND THE NEGLECT OF OTHERS MRS MASON HAD A NUMBER OF VISITORS ONE FORENOON WHO CONVERSED IN THE USUAL THOUGHTLESS MANNER WHICH PEOPLE OFTEN FALL INTO WHO DO NOT CONSIDER BEFORE THEY SPEAK THEY TALKED OF CAROLINES BEAUTY AND SHE GAVE HERSELF MANY AFFECTED AIRS TO MAKE IT APPEAR TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE BUT MARY WHO HAD NOT A FACE TO BE PROUD OF WAS OBSERVING SOME PECULIARITIES IN THE DRESS OR MANNERS OF THE GUESTS AND ONE VERY RESPECTABLE OLD LADY WHO HAD LOST HER TEETH AFFORDED HER MORE DIVERSION THAN ANY OF THE REST THE CHILDREN WENT TO BED WITHOUT BEING REPROVED THOUGH MRS MASON WHEN SHE DISMISSED THEM SAID GRAVELY I GIVE YOU TONIGHT A KISS OF PEACE AN AFFECTIONATE ONE YOU HAVE NOT DESERVED THEY THEREFORE DISCOVERED BY HER BEHAVIOUR THAT THEY HAD DONE WRONG AND WAITED FOR AN EXPLANATION TO REGAIN HER FAVOUR SHE WAS NEVER IN A PASSION BUT HER QUIET STEADY DISPLEASURE MADE THEM FEEL SO LITTLE IN THEIR OWN EYES THEY WISHED HER TO SMILE THAT THEY MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR ALL THEIR CONSEQUENCE SEEMED TO ARISE FROM HER APPROBATION I DECLARE SAID CAROLINE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE DONE AND YET I AM SURE I NEVER KNEW MRS MASON FIND FAULT WITHOUT CONVINCING ME THAT I HAD DONE WRONG DID YOU MARY EVER SEE HER IN A PASSION NO SAID MARY I DO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS NEVER ANGRY IN HER LIFE WHEN JOHN THREW DOWN ALL THE CHINA AND STOOD TREMBLING SHE WAS THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THE CARPET MADE HIM STUMBLE YES NOW I DO REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO HER HOUSE JOHN FORGOT TO BRING THE COW AND HER YOUNG CALF INTO THE COWHOUSE I HEARD HER BID HIM DO IT DIRECTLY AND THE POOR CALF WAS ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATHSHE SPOKE THEN IN A HURRY AND SEEMED ANGRY NOW YOU MENTION IT I DO RECOLLECT REPLIED CAROLINE THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WHEN BETTY DID NOT CARRY THE POOR SICK WOMAN THE BROTH SHE ORDERED HER TO TAKE TO HER BUT THIS IS NOT LIKE THE PASSION I USED TO SEE NURSE IN WHEN ANY THING VEXED HER SHE WOULD SCOLD US AND BEAT THE GIRL WHO WAITED ON HER POOR LITTLE JENNY MANY A TIME WAS SHE BEATEN WHEN WE VEXED NURSE I WOULD TELL HER SHE WAS TO BLAME NOW IF I SAW HER AND I WOULD NOT TEASE HER ANY MORE I DECLARE I CANNOT GO TO SLEEP SAID MARY I AM AFRAID OF MRS MASONS EYESWOULD YOU THINK CAROLINE THAT SHE WHO LOOKS SO VERY GOODNATURED SOMETIMES COULD FRIGHTEN ONE SO I WISH I WERE AS WISE AND AS GOOD AS SHE IS THE POOR WOMAN WITH THE SIX CHILDREN WHOM WE MET ON THE COMMON SAID SHE WAS AN ANGEL AND THAT SHE HAD SAVED HERS AND HER CHILDRENS LIVES MY HEART IS IN MY MOUTH INDEED REPLIED CAROLINE WHEN I THINK OF TOMORROW MORNING AND YET I AM MUCH HAPPIER THAN I WAS WHEN WE WERE AT HOME I CRIED I CANNOT NOW TELL FOR WHAT ALL DAY I NEVER WISHED TO BE GOODNOBODY TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS TO BE GOOD I WISH TO BE A WOMAN SAID MARY AND TO BE LIKE MRS MASON OR MRS TRUEMANWE ARE TO GO TO SEE HER IF WE BEHAVE WELL SLEEP SOON OVERPOWERED THEM AND THEY FORGOT THEIR APPREHENSIONS IN THE MORNING THEY AWOKE REFRESHED AND TOOK CARE TO LEARN THEIR LESSONS AND FEED THEIR CHICKENS BEFORE MRS MASON LEFT HER CHAMBER CHAP VII VIRTUE THE SOUL OF BEAUTYTHE TULIP AND THE ROSETHE NIGHTINGALEEXTERNAL ORNAMENTSCHARACTERS THE NEXT MORNING MRS MASON MET THEM FIRST IN THE GARDEN AND SHE DESIRED CAROLINE TO LOOK AT A BED OF TULIPS THAT WERE THEN IN THEIR HIGHEST STATE OF PERFECTION I ADDED SHE CHOOSE TO HAVE EVERY KIND OF FLOWER IN MY GARDEN AS THE SUCCESSION ENABLES ME TO VARY MY DAILY PROSPECT AND GIVES IT THE CHARM OF VARIETY YET THESE TULIPS AFFORD ME LESS PLEASURE THAN MOST OF THE OTHER SORT WHICH I CULTIVATEAND I WILL TELL YOU WHYTHEY ARE ONLY BEAUTIFUL LISTEN TO MY DISTINCTIONGOOD FEATURES AND A FINE COMPLEXION I TERM BODILY BEAUTY LIKE THE STREAKS IN THE TULIP THEY PLEASE THE EYE FOR A MOMENT BUT THIS UNIFORMITY SOON TIRES AND THE ACTIVE MIND FLIES OFF TO SOMETHING ELSE THE SOUL OF BEAUTY MY DEAR CHILDREN CONSISTS IN THE BODY GRACEFULLY EXHIBITING THE EMOTIONS AND VARIATIONS OF THE INFORMING MIND IF TRUTH HUMANITY AND KNOWLEDGE INHABIT THE BREAST THE EYES WILL BEAM WITH A MILD LUSTRE MODESTY WILL SUFFUSE THE CHEEKS AND SMILES OF INNOCENT JOY PLAY OVER ALL THE FEATURES AT FIRST SIGHT REGULARITY AND COLOUR WILL ATTRACT AND HAVE THE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE HIDDEN SPRINGS ARE NOT DIRECTLY SET IN MOTION BUT WHEN INTERNAL GOODNESS IS REFLECTED EVERY OTHER KIND OF BEAUTY THE SHADOW OF IT WITHERS AWAY BEFORE IT AS THE SUN OBSCURES A LAMP YOU ARE CERTAINLY HANDSOME CAROLINE I MEAN HAVE GOOD FEATURES BUT YOU MUST IMPROVE YOUR MIND TO GIVE THEM A PLEASING EXPRESSION OR THEY WILL ONLY SERVE TO LEAD YOUR UNDERSTANDING ASTRAY I HAVE SEEN SOME FOOLISH PEOPLE TAKE GREAT PAINS TO DECORATE THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOUSES TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF STRANGERS WHO GAZED AND PASSED ON WHILST THE INSIDE WHERE THEY RECEIVED THEIR FRIENDS WAS DARK AND INCONVENIENT APPLY THIS OBSERVATION TO MERE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS THEY MAY IT IS TRUE FOR A FEW YEARS CHARM THE SUPERFICIAL PART OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WHOSE NOTIONS OF BEAUTY ARE NOT BUILT ON ANY PRINCIPLE OF UTILITY SUCH PERSONS MIGHT LOOK AT YOU AS THEY WOULD GLANCE THEIR EYE OVER THESE TULIPS AND FEEL FOR A MOMENT THE SAME PLEASURE THAT A VIEW OF THE VARIEGATED RAYS OF LIGHT WOULD CONVEY TO A UNINFORMED MIND THE LOWER CLASS OF MANKIND AND CHILDREN ARE FOND OF FINERY GAUDY DAZZLING APPEARANCES CATCH THEIR ATTENTION BUT THE DISCRIMINATING JUDGMENT OF A PERSON OF SENSE REQUIRES BESIDES COLOUR ORDER PROPORTION GRACE AND USEFULNESS TO RENDER THE IDEA OF BEAUTY COMPLETE OBSERVE THAT ROSE IT HAS ALL THE PERFECTIONS I SPEAK OF COLOUR GRACE AND SWEETNESSAND EVEN WHEN THE FINE TINTS FADE THE SMELL IS GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEFORE CONTEMPLATED ITS BEAUTIES I HAVE ONLY ONE BED OF TULIPS THOUGH MY GARDEN IS LARGE BUT IN EVERY PART OF IT ROSES ATTRACT THE EYE YOU HAVE SEEN MRS TRUEMAN AND THINK HER A VERY FINE WOMAN YET HER SKIN AND COMPLEXION HAVE ONLY THE CLEARNESS THAT TEMPERANCE GIVES AND HER FEATURES STRICTLY SPEAKING ARE NOT REGULAR BETTY THE HOUSEMAID HAS IN BOTH THESE RESPECTS MUCH THE SUPERIORITY OVER HER BUT THOUGH IT IS NOT EASY TO DEFINE IN WHAT HER BEAUTY CONSISTS THE EYE FOLLOWS HER WHENEVER SHE MOVES AND EVERY PERSON OF TASTE LISTENS FOR THE MODULATED SOUNDS WHICH PROCEED OUT OF HER MOUTH TO BE IMPROVED AND PLEASED IT IS CONSCIOUS WORTH TRUTH THAT GIVES DIGNITY TO HER WALK AND SIMPLE ELEGANCE TO HER CONVERSATION SHE HAS INDEED A MOST EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING AND A FEELING HEART SAGACITY AND TENDERNESS THE RESULT OF BOTH ARE HAPPILY BLENDED IN HER COUNTENANCE AND TASTE IS THE POLISH WHICH MAKES THEM APPEAR TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE SHE IS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL AND YOU SEE HER VARIED EXCELLENCIES AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH INCREASING PLEASURE THEY ARE NOT OBTRUDED ON YOU FOR KNOWLEDGE HAS TAUGHT HER TRUE HUMILITY SHE IS NOT LIKE THE FLAUNTING TULIP THAT FORCES ITSELF FORWARD INTO NOTICE BUT RESEMBLES THE MODEST ROSE YOU SEE YONDER RETIRING UNDER ITS ELEGANT FOLIAGE I HAVE MENTIONED FLOWERSTHE SAME ORDER IS OBSERVED IN THE HIGHER DEPARTMENTS OF NATURE THINK OF THE BIRDS THOSE THAT SING BEST HAVE NOT THE FINEST PLUMAGE INDEED JUST THE CONTRARY GOD DIVIDES HIS GIFTS AND AMONGST THE FEATHERED RACE THE NIGHTINGALE SWEETEST OF WARBLERS WHO POURS FORTH HER VARIED STRAIN WHEN SOBER EYE COMES ON YOU WOULD SEEK IN VAIN IN THE MORNING IF YOU EXPECTED THAT BEAUTIFUL FEATHERS SHOULD POINT OUT THE SONGSTRESS MANY WHO INCESSANTLY TWITTER AND ARE ONLY TOLERABLE IN THE GENERAL CONCERT WOULD SURPASS HER AND ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION I KNEW SOME TIME BEFORE YOU WERE BORN A VERY FINE A VERY HANDSOME GIRL I SAW SHE HAD ABILITIES AND I SAW WITH PAIN THAT SHE ATTENDED TO THE MOST OBVIOUS BUT LEAST VALUABLE GIFT OF HEAVEN HER INGENUITY SLEPT WHILST SHE TRIED TO RENDER HER PERSON MORE ALLURING AT LAST SHE CAUGHT THE SMALLPOXHER BEAUTY VANISHED AND SHE WAS FOR A TIME MISERABLE BUT THE NATURAL VIVACITY OF YOUTH OVERCAME HER UNPLEASANT FEELINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISORDER HER EYES BECAME SO WEAK THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT IN A DARK ROOM TO BEGUILE THE TEDIOUS DAY SHE APPLIED TO MUSIC AND MADE A SURPRISING PROFICIENCY SHE EVEN BEGAN TO THINK IN HER RETIREMENT AND WHEN SHE RECOVERED HER SIGHT GREW FOND OF READING LARGE COMPANIES DID NOT NOW AMUSE HER SHE WAS NO LONGER THE OBJECT OF ADMIRATION OR IF SHE WAS TAKEN NOTICE OF IT WAS TO BE PITIED TO HEAR HER FORMER SELF PRAISED AND TO HEAR THEM LAMENT THE DEPREDATION THAT DREADFUL DISEASE HAD MADE IN A FINE FACE NOT EXPECTING OR WISHING TO BE OBSERVED SHE LOST HER AFFECTED AIRS AND ATTENDED TO THE CONVERSATION IN WHICH SHE WAS SOON ABLE TO BEAR A PART IN SHORT THE DESIRE OF PLEASING TOOK A DIFFERENT TURN AND AS SHE IMPROVED HER MIND SHE DISCOVERED THAT VIRTUE INTERNAL BEAUTY WAS VALUABLE ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT AND NOT LIKE THAT OF THE PERSON WHICH RESEMBLES A TOY THAT PLEASES THE OBSERVER BUT DOES NOT RENDER THE POSSESSOR HAPPY SHE FOUND THAT IN ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE HER MIND GREW TRANQUIL AND THE NOBLE DESIRE OF ACTING CONFORMABLY TO THE WILL OF GOD SUCCEEDED AND DROVE OUT THE IMMODERATE VANITY WHICH BEFORE ACTUATED HER WHEN HER EQUALS WERE THE OBJECTS SHE THOUGHT MOST OF AND WHOSE APPROBATION SHE SOUGHT WITH SUCH EAGERNESS AND WHAT HAD SHE SOUGHT TO BE STARED AT AND CALLED HANDSOME HER BEAUTY THE MERE SIGHT OF IT DID NOT MAKE OTHERS GOOD OR COMFORT THE AFFLICTED BUT AFTER SHE HAD LOST IT SHE WAS COMFORTABLE HERSELF AND SET HER FRIENDS THE MOST USEFUL EXAMPLE THE MONEY THAT SHE HAD FORMERLY APPROPRIATED TO ORNAMENT HER PERSON NOW CLOTHED THE NAKED YET SHE REALLY APPEARED BETTER DRESSED AS SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING HER TIME TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE AND COULD MAKE MANY THINGS HERSELF BESIDES SHE DID NOT IMPLICITLY FOLLOW THE REIGNING FASHION FOR SHE HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH AND IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS ACTED ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF GOOD SENSE THE CHILDREN MADE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS STORY BUT THE ENTRANCE OF A VISITOR INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION AND THEY RAN ABOUT THE GARDEN COMPARING THE ROSES AND TULIPS CHAP VIII SUMMER EVENINGS AMUSEMENTTHE ARRIVAL OF A FAMILY OF HAYMAKERSRIDICULE OF PERSONAL DEFECTS CENSUREDA STORMTHE FEAR OF DEATHTHE COTTAGE OF HONEST JACK THE SHIPWRECKED SAILORTHE HISTORY OF JACK AND HIS FAITHFUL DOG POMPEY THE EVENING WAS PLEASANT MRS MASON AND THE CHILDREN WALKED OUT AND MANY RUSTIC NOISES STRUCK THEIR EARS SOME BELLS IN A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE SOFTENED BY THE DISTANCE SOUNDED PLEASINGLY THE BEETLES HUMMED AND THE CHILDREN PURSUED THEM NOT TO DESTROY THEM BUT TO OBSERVE THEIR FORM AND ASK QUESTIONS CONCERNING THEIR MODE OF LIVING SHEEP WERE BLEATING AND CATTLE LOWING THE RIVULET NEAR THEM BABBLED ALONG WHILE THE SOUND OF THE DISTANT OCEAN DIED AWAY ON THE EAROR THEY FORGOT IT LISTENING TO THE WHISTLING OF THE HAYMAKERS WHO WERE RETURNING FROM THE FIELD THEY MET A WHOLE FAMILY WHO CAME EVERY YEAR FROM ANOTHER COUNTY WHERE THEY COULD NOT FIND CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT AND MRS MASON ALLOWED THEM TO SLEEP IN HER BARN THE LITTLE ONES KNEW THEIR BENEFACTRESS AND TRIED TO CATCH A SMILE AND SHE WAS EVER READY TO SMILE ON THOSE WHOM SHE OBLIGED FOR SHE LOVED ALL HER FELLOWCREATURES AND LOVE LIGHTENS OBLIGATIONS BESIDES SHE THOUGHT THAT THE POOR WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK HAD A RIGHT TO THE COMFORTS OF LIFE A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THEY MET A DEFORMED WOMAN THE CHILDREN STARED HER ALMOST OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT MRS MASON TURNED HER HEAD ANOTHER WAY AND WHEN THE POOR OBJECT WAS OUT OF HEARING SAID TO MARY I INTENDED TO REPROVE YOU THIS MORNING FOR A FAULT WHICH I HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN YOU COMMIT AND THIS MOMENT AND THE OTHER EVENING IT WAS PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS WHEN THAT DEFORMED WOMAN PASSED US I INVOLUNTARILY LOOKED AT SOMETHING ELSE AND WOULD NOT LET HER PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS A DISGUSTING FIGURE AND ATTRACTED NOTICE ON THAT ACCOUNT I SAY I DID IT INVOLUNTARILY FOR I HAVE ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO THINK OF OTHERS AND WHAT THEY WILL SUFFER ON ALL OCCASIONS AND THIS LOTHNESS TO OFFEND OR EVEN TO HURT THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER IS AN INSTANTANEOUS SPRING WHICH ACTUATES MY CONDUCT AND MAKES ME KINDLY AFFECTED TO EVERY THING THAT BREATHES IF I THEN AM SO CAREFUL NOT TO WOUND A STRANGER WHAT SHALL I THINK OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR MARY WHEN YOU LAUGHED AT A RESPECTABLE OLD WOMAN WHO BESIDE HER VIRTUES AND HER AGE HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY CIVIL TO YOU I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN PERSONS OF THE WEAKEST UNDERSTANDINGS AND WHOSE HEARTS BENEVOLENCE SELDOM TOUCHED RIDICULE BODILY INFIRMITIES AND ACCIDENTAL DEFECTS THEY COULD ONLY RELISH THE INFERIOR KIND OF BEAUTY WHICH I DESCRIBED THIS MORNING AND A SILLY JOY HAS ELATED THEIR EMPTY SOULS ON FINDING BY COMPARISON THAT THEY WERE SUPERIOR TO OTHERS IN THAT RESPECT THOUGH THE CONCLUSION WAS ERRONEOUS FOR MERIT MENTAL ACQUIREMENTS CAN ONLY GIVE A JUST CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY HAD YOU POSSESSED THE SMALLEST PORTION OF DISCERNMENT YOU WOULD SOON HAVE FORGOTTEN THE TONES LOSS OF TEETH MADE DRAWLING IN LISTENING TO THE CHEARFUL GOOD SENSE WHICH THAT WORTHY WOMANS WORDS CONVEYED YOU LAUGHED BECAUSE YOU WERE IGNORANT AND I NOW EXCUSE YOU BUT SOME YEARS HENCE IF I WERE TO SEE YOU IN COMPANY WITH SUCH A PROPENSITY I SHOULD STILL THINK YOU A CHILD AN OVERGROWN ONE WHOSE MIND DID NOT EXPAND AS THE BODY GREW THE SKY BEGAN TO THICKEN AND THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE TO HAVE A MELANCHOLY CADENCE THE NIGHTINGALE FORGOT HER SONG AND FLED TO HER NEST AND THE SEA ROARED AND LASHED THE ROCKS DURING THE CALM WHICH PORTENDED AN APPROACHING STORM EVERY CREATURE WAS RUNNING FOR SHELTERWE MUST IF POSSIBLE SAID MRS MASON REACH YON COTTAGE ON THE CLIFF FOR WE SHALL SOON HAVE A VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM THEY QUICKENED THEIR PACE BUT THE HURRICANE OVERTOOK THEM THE HAILSTONES FELL THE CLOUDS SEEMED TO OPEN AND DISCLOSE THE LIGHTNING WHILE LOUD PEALS OF THUNDER SHOOK THE GROUND THE WIND ALSO IN VIOLENT GUSTS RUSHED AMONG THE TREES TORE OFF THE SLENDER BRANCHES AND LOOSENED THE ROOTS THE CHILDREN WERE TERRIFIED BUT MRS MASON GAVE THEM EACH A HAND AND CHATTED WITH THEM TO DISPEL THEIR FEARS SHE INFORMED THEM THAT STORMS WERE NECESSARY TO DISSIPATE NOXIOUS VAPOURS AND TO ANSWER MANY OTHER PURPOSES WHICH WERE NOT PERHAPS OBVIOUS TO OUR WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS BUT ARE YOU NOT AFRAID CRIED THE TREMBLING CAROLINE NO CERTAINLY I AM NOT AFRAIDI WALK WITH THE SAME SECURITY AS WHEN THE SUN ENLIVENED THE PROSPECTGOD IS STILL PRESENT AND WE ARE SAFE SHOULD THE FLASH THAT PASSES BY US STRIKE ME DEAD IT CANNOT HURT ME I FEAR NOT DEATHI ONLY FEAR THAT BEING WHO CAN RENDER DEATH TERRIBLE ON WHOSE PROVIDENCE I CALMLY REST AND MY CONFIDENCE EARTHLY SORROWS CANNOT DESTROY A MIND IS NEVER TRULY GREAT TILL THE LOVE OF VIRTUE OVERCOMES THE FEAR OF DEATH BY THIS TIME THEY HAD MOUNTED THE CLIFF AND SAW THE TUMULTUOUS DEEP THE ANGRY BILLOWS ROSE AND DASHED AGAINST THE SHORE AND THE LOUD NOISE OF THE RAGING SEA RESOUNDED FROM ROCK TO ROCK THEY RAN INTO THE COTTAGE THE POOR WOMAN WHO LIVED IN IT SENT HER CHILDREN FOR WOOD AND SOON MADE A GOOD FIRE TO DRY THEM THE FATHER OF THE FAMILY SOON AFTER CAME IN LEANING ON CRUTCHES AND OVER ONE EYE THERE WAS A LARGE PATCH I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HONEST JACK SAID MRS MASON COME AND TAKE YOUR SEAT BY THE FIRE AND TELL THE CHILDREN THE STORY OF YOUR SHIPWRECK HE INSTANTLY COMPLIED I WAS VERY YOUNG MY DEAR LADIES SAID JACK WHEN I WENT TO SEA AND ENDURED MANY HARDSHIPSHOWEVER I MADE A SHIFT TO WEATHER THEM ALL AND WHETHER THE WIND WAS FAIR OR FOUL I RAN UP THE SHROUDS AND SUNG AT THE HELM I HAD ALWAYS A GOOD HEART NO LAD FORE OR AFT HAD A BETTER WHEN WE WERE AT SEA I NEVER WAS THE FIRST TO FLINCH AND ON SHORE I WAS AS MERRY AS THE BEST OF THEM I MARRIED SHE YOU SEE YONDER LIFTING HIS CRUTCH TO POINT TO HIS WIFE AND HER WORK AND MY WAGES DID TOGETHER TILL I WAS SHIPWRECKED ON THESE ROCKS OH IT WAS A DREADFUL NIGHT THIS IS NOTHING TO IT BUT I AM GETTING TO THE END OF MY STORY BEFORE I BEGIN IT DURING THE WAR I WENT ONCE OR TWICE TO NEW YORK THE LAST WAS A GOOD VOYAGE AND WE WERE ALL RETURNING WITH JOY TO DEAR ENGLAND WHEN THE STORM ROSE THE VESSEL WAS LIKE A BIRD IT FLEW UP AND DOWN AND SEVERAL OF OUR BEST HANDS WERE WASHED CLEAN OVERBOARDMY POOR CAPTAIN A BETTER NEVER PLOWED THE OCEAN HE FELL OVERBOARD TOO AND IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE WE MISSED HIM FOR IT WAS QUITE DARK EXCEPT THAT FLASHES OF LIGHTNING NOW AND THEN GAVE US LIGHT I WAS AT THE HELM LASHING IT TO THE SIDE OF THE SHIPA DREADFUL FLASH CAME ACROSS ME AND I LOST ONE OF MY PRECIOUS EYESBUT THANK GOD I HAVE ONE LEFT THE WEATHER CLEARED UP NEXT DAY AND THOUGH WE HAD BEEN FINELY MAULED I BEGAN TO HOPE FOR I HATE TO BE FAINTHEARTED AND CERTAINLY WE SHOULD HAVE GOT INTO THE CHANNEL VERY SOON IF WE HAD NOT FELL IN WITH A FRENCH MAN OF WAR WHICH TOOK US FOR WE COULD NOT MAKE ANY RESISTANCE I HAD A DOG POOR POMPEY WITH ME POMPEY WOULD NOT LEAVE ME HE WAS AS FOND OF ME AS IF HE HAD BEEN A CHRISTIAN I HAD LOST ONE EYE BY THE LIGHTNING THE OTHER HAD BEEN SORE SO THAT I COULD HARDLY CALL IT A PEEPHOLE SOMEHOW I FELL DOWN THE HATCHWAY AND BRUISED ONE OF MY LEGS BUT I DID NOT MIND IT DO YE SEE TILL WE ARRIVED AT BREST AND WERE THROWN INTO A FRENCH PRISON THERE I WAS WORSE OFF THAN EVER THE ROOM WE WERE ALL STOWED IN WAS FULL OF VERMIN AND OUR FOOD VERY BAD MOULDY BISCUITS AND SALT FISH THE PRISON WAS CHOKE FULL AND MANY A MORNING DID WE FIND SOME HONEST FELLOW WITH HIS CHOPS FALLENHE WAS NOT TO BE WAKED ANY MOREHE WAS GONE TO THE OTHER COUNTRY DO YE SEE YET THE FRENCH HAVE NOT SUCH HARD HEARTS AS PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE SEVERAL WOMEN BROUGHT US BROTH AND WINE AND ONE GAVE ME SOME RAGS TO WRAP ROUND MY LEG IT WAS VERY PAINFUL I COULD NOT CLEAN IT NOR HAD I ANY PLAISTER ONE DAY I WAS LOOKING SORROWFULLY AT IT THINKING FOR CERTAIN I SHOULD LOSE MY PRECIOUS LIMB WHEN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT POMPEY SAW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT AND BEGAN TO LICK ITAND I NEVER KNEW SUCH A SURPRIZING THING IT GREW BETTER AND BETTER EVERY DAY AND AT LAST WAS HEALED WITHOUT ANY PLAISTER AFTER THAT I WAS VERY SICK AND THE SAME TENDERHEARTED CREATURE WHO GAVE ME THE RAGS TOOK ME TO HER HOUSE AND FRESH AIR SOON RECOVERED ME I FOR CERTAIN OUGHT TO SPEAK WELL OF THE FRENCH BUT FOR THEIR KINDNESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN ANOTHER PORT BY THIS TIME MAYHAP I MIGHT HAVE GONE WITH A FAIR WIND YET I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY TO HAVE LEFT MY POOR WIFE AND HER CHILDREN BUT I AM LETTING ALL MY LINE RUN OUT WELL BYANDBY THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS AND WE WERE ONCE MORE IN AN ENGLISH VESSEL AND I MADE SURE OF SEEING MY FAMILY AGAIN BUT THE WEATHER WAS STILL FOUL THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WE WERE IN THE GREATEST DISTRESS AND THE FOURTH THE SHIP WAS DASHED AGAINST THESE ROCKS OH IF YOU HAD HEARD THE CRASH THE WATER RUSHED INTHE MEN SCREAMED LORD HAVE MERCY ON US THERE WAS A WOMAN IN THE SHIP AND AS I COULD SWIM I TRIED TO SAVE HER AND POMPEY FOLLOWED ME BUT I LOST HIMPOOR FELLOW I DECLARE I CRIED LIKE A CHILD WHEN I SAW HIS DEAD BODY HOWEVER I BROUGHT THE WOMAN TO SHORE AND ASSISTED SOME MORE OF MY MESSMATES BUT STANDING IN THE WATER SO LONG I LOST THE USE OF MY LIMBSYET HEAVEN WAS GOOD TO ME MADAM THERE SENT A CART FOR US ALL AND TOOK CARE OF US BUT I NEVER RECOVERED THE USE OF MY LIMBS SO SHE ASKED ME ALL ABOUT MY MISFORTUNES AND SENT FOR WIFE WHO CAME DIRECTLY AND WE HAVE LIVED HERE EVER SINCE WE CATCH FISH FOR MADAM AND I WATCH FOR A STORM HOPING SOME TIME OR OTHER TO BE AS KIND TO A POOR PERISHING SOUL AS SHE HAS BEEN TO ME INDEED WE ARE VERY HAPPYI MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN BEGGING ABOUT THE STREETS BUT FOR MADAM GOD BLESS HER A TEAR STRAYED DOWN MRS MASONS CHEEK WHILE A SMILE OF BENEVOLENCE LIGHTED UP HER COUNTENANCETHE LITTLE GIRLS CAUGHT EACH HANDTHEY WERE ALL SILENT A FEW MINUTES WHEN SHE WILLING TO TURN THE DISCOURSE ENQUIRED WHETHER THEY HAD ANY FISH IN THE HOUSE SOME WERE PRODUCED THEY WERE QUICKLY DRESSED AND THEY ALL EAT TOGETHER THEY HAD A CHEARFUL MEAL AND HONEST JACK SUNG SOME OF HIS SEAFARING SONGS AND DID ALL HE COULD TO DIVERT THEM AND EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE GETTING UP TO REACH THE BROWN LOAF HE LIMPED VERY AWKWARDLY MARY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO LAUGH WHEN SHE RESTRAINED HERSELF FOR SHE RECOLLECTED THAT HIS AWKWARDNESS MADE HIM TRULY RESPECTABLE BECAUSE HE HAD LOST THE USE OF HIS LIMBS WHEN HE WAS DOING GOOD SAVING THE LIVES OF HIS FELLOWCREATURES THE WEATHER CLEARED UP AND THEY RETURNED HOME THE CHILDREN CONVERSED GAILY WITH EACH OTHER ALL THE WAY HOME TALKING OF THE POOR SAILOR AND HIS FAITHFUL DOG CHAP IX THE INCONVENIENCES OF IMMODERATE INDULGENCE THE CHILDREN WERE ALLOWED TO HELP THEMSELVES TO FRUIT WHEN IT MADE A PART OF THEIR MEAL AND CAROLINE ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO PICK OUT THE BEST OR SWALLOW WHAT SHE TOOK IN A HURRY LEST SHE SHOULD NOT GET AS MUCH AS SHE WISHED FOR INDEED SHE GENERALLY EAT MORE THAN HER SHARE SHE HAD SEVERAL TIMES EATEN MORE THAN A PERSON OUGHT TO EAT AT ONE TIME WITHOUT FEELING ANY ILL EFFECTS BUT ONE AFTERNOON SHE COMPLAINED OF A PAIN IN HER STOMACH IN CONSEQUENCE OF IT AND HER PALE FACE AND LANGUID EYES PLAINLY SHEWED HER INDISPOSITION MRS MASON GAVE HER AN EMETIC AND AFTER THE OPERATION SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED THOUGH SHE HAD PROMISED HERSELF A PLEASANT WALK THAT EVENING SHE WAS LEFT ALONE FOR MARY WAS NOT PERMITTED TO STAY AT HOME WITH HER AS SHE OFFERED TO DO HAD HER SICKNESS BEEN ACCIDENTAL WE WOULD BOTH HAVE TRIED TO AMUSE HER SAID MRS MASON BUT HER GREEDINESS NOW RECEIVING ITS NATURAL AND JUST PUNISHMENT SHE MUST ENDURE IT WITHOUT THE ALLEVIATION WHICH PITY AFFORDS ONLY TELL HER FROM ME THAT THE PLEASURE WAS BUT MOMENTARY WHILE THE PAIN AND CONFINEMENT IT PRODUCED HAS ALREADY LASTED SOME HOURS THE NEXT MORNING THOUGH SCARCELY RECOVERED SHE GOT UP AS USUAL TO HAVE A WALK BEFORE BREAKFAST DURING THESE WALKS MRS MASON TOLD THEM STORIES POINTED OUT THE WISDOM OF GOD IN THE CREATION AND TOOK THEM TO VISIT HER POOR TENANTS THESE VISITS NOT ONLY ENABLED HER TO FORM A JUDGMENT OF THEIR WANTS BUT MADE THEM VERY INDUSTRIOUS FOR THEY WERE ALL ANXIOUS THAT SHE MIGHT FIND THEIR HOUSES AND PERSONS CLEAN AND RETURNING THROUGH THE FARMYARD MRS MASON STOPPED ACCORDING TO CUSTOM TO SEE WHETHER THE POOR ANIMALS WERE TAKEN CARE OFTHIS SHE CALLED EARNING HER BREAKFAST THE SERVANT WAS JUST FEEDING THE PIGS AND THOUGH SHE POURED A GREAT QUANTITY INTO THE TROUGH THE GREEDY CREATURES TRIED TO GOBBLE IT UP FROM ONE ANOTHER CAROLINE BLUSHED SHE SAW THIS SIGHT WAS MEANT FOR HER AND SHE FELT ASHAMED OF HER GLUTTONY BUT MRS MASON WILLING TO IMPRESS HER STILL MORE STRONGLY THUS ADDRESSED HER PROVIDENCE MY CHILD HAS GIVEN US PASSIONS AND APPETITES FOR VARIOUS PURPOSESTWO ARE GENERALLY OBVIOUS I WILL POINT THEM OUT TO YOU FIRST TO RENDER OUR PRESENT LIFE MORE COMFORTABLE AND THEN TO PREPARE US FOR ANOTHER BY MAKING US SOCIABLE BEINGS AS IN SOCIETY VIRTUE IS ACQUIRED AND SELFDENIAL PRACTISED A MODERATE QUANTITY OF PROPER FOOD RECRUITS OUR EXHAUSTED SPIRITS AND INVIGORATES THE ANIMAL FUNCTIONS BUT IF WE EXCEED MODERATION THE MIND WILL BE OPPRESSED AND SOON BECOME THE SLAVE OF THE BODY OR BOTH GROW LISTLESS AND INACTIVE EMPLOYED VARIOUS WAYS FAMILIES MEET AT MEALS AND THERE GIVING UP TO EACH OTHER LEARN IN THE MOST EASY PLEASANT WAY TO GOVERN THEIR APPETITES PIGS YOU SEE DEVOUR WHAT THEY CAN GET BUT MEN IF THEY HAVE ANY AFFECTIONS LOVE THEIR FELLOWCREATURES AND WISH FOR A RETURN NOR WILL THEY FOR THE SAKE OF A BRUTISH GRATIFICATION LOSE THE ESTEEM OF THOSE THEY VALUE BESIDES NO ONE CAN BE RECKONED VIRTUOUS WHO HAS NOT LEARNED TO BEAR POVERTY YET THOSE WHO THINK MUCH OF GRATIFYING THEIR APPETITES WILL AT LAST ACT MEANLY IN ORDER TO INDULGE THEM BUT WHEN ANY EMPLOYMENT OF THE UNDERSTANDING OR STRONG AFFECTION OCCUPIES THE MIND EATING IS SELDOM THOUGHT A MATTER OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN IT OUGHT TO BE LET THE IDLE THINK OF THEIR MEALS BUT DO YOU EMPLOY THE INTERMEDIATE TIME IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND ONLY ENJOY THEM WHEN YOU JOIN THE SOCIAL CIRCLE I LIKE TO SEE CHILDREN AND EVEN MEN EAT CHEARFULLY AND GRATEFULLY RECEIVE THE BLESSINGS SENT BY HEAVEN YET I WOULD NOT HAVE THEM ABUSE THOSE BLESSINGS OR EVER LET THE CARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE BODY INJURE THE IMMORTAL SPIRIT MANY THINK OF THE SUSTENANCE THE FORMER CRAVES AND ENTIRELY NEGLECT THE LATTER I REMARKED TO YOU BEFORE THAT IN THE MOST APPARENTLY TRIVIAL CONCERNS WE ARE TO DO AS WE WOULD BE DONE BY THIS DUTY MUST BE PRACTISED CONSTANTLY AT MEALS THERE ARE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES AND I HOPE CAROLINE I SHALL NEVER AGAIN SEE YOU EAGER TO SECURE DAINTIES FOR YOURSELF IF SUCH A DISPOSITION WERE TO GROW UP WITH YOU YOU OUGHT TO LIVE ALONE FOR NO ONE SHOULD ENJOY THE ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES WHICH ARISE FROM SOCIAL INTERCOURSE WHO IS UNWILLING TO GIVE WAY TO THE INCLINATIONS OF OTHERS AND ALLOW EACH THEIR SHARE OF THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE YOU EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY THAT PAIN FOLLOWS IMMODERATE INDULGENCE IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE THOUGH SOMETIMES NOT FELT SO IMMEDIATELY BUT THE CONSTITUTION IS INSENSIBLY DESTROYED AND OLD AGE WILL COME ON LOADED WITH INFIRMITIES YOU ALSO LOST A VERY PLEASANT WALK AND SOME FINE FRUIT WE VISITED MRS GOODWINS GARDEN AND AS MARY HAD BEFORE CONVINCED ME THAT SHE COULD REGULATE HER APPETITES I GAVE HER LEAVE TO PLUCK AS MUCH FRUIT AS SHE WISHED AND SHE DID NOT ABUSE MY INDULGENCE ON THE CONTRARY SHE SPENT MOST PART OF THE TIME IN GATHERING SOME FOR ME AND HER ATTENTION MADE IT TASTE SWEETER COMING HOME I CALLED HER MY FRIEND AND SHE DESERVED THE NAME FOR SHE WAS NO LONGER A CHILD A REASONABLE AFFECTION HAD CONQUERED AN APPETITE HER UNDERSTANDING TOOK THE LEAD AND SHE HAD PRACTISED A VIRTUE THE SUBJECT WAS NOW DROPPED BUT CAROLINE DETERMINED TO COPY IN FUTURE HER SISTERS TEMPERANCE AND SELFDENIAL CHAP X THE DANGER OF DELAYDESCRIPTION OF A MANSIONHOUSE IN RUINSTHE HISTORY OF CHARLES TOWNLEY MRS MASON WHO ALWAYS REGULATED HER OWN TIME AND NEVER LOITERED HER HOURS IRRESOLUTELY AWAY HAD VERY FREQUENTLY TO WAIT FOR THE CHILDREN WHEN SHE WISHED TO WALK THOUGH SHE HAD DESIRED THEM TO BE READY AT A PRECISE TIME MARY IN PARTICULAR HAD A TRICK OF PUTTING EVERY THING OFF TILL THE LAST MOMENT AND THEN SHE DID BUT HALF DO IT OR LEFT IT UNDONE THIS INDOLENT WAY OF DELAYING MADE HER MISS MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF OBLIGING AND DOING GOOD AND WHOLE HOURS WERE LOST IN THOUGHTLESS IDLENESS WHICH SHE AFTERWARDS WISHED HAD BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED THIS WAS THE CASE ONE DAY WHEN SHE HAD A LETTER TO WRITE TO HER FATHER AND THOUGH IT WAS MENTIONED TO HER EARLY IN THE MORNING THE FINEST PART OF THE EVENING SLIPPED AWAY WHILST SHE WAS FINISHING IT AND HER HASTE MADE HER FORGET THE PRINCIPAL THING WHICH SHE INTENDED TO HAVE SAID OUT OF BREATH SHE JOINED THEM AND AFTER THEY HAD CROSSED SEVERAL FIELDS MRS MASON TURNING DOWN A LONG AVENUE BADE THEM LOOK AT A LARGE OLD MANSIONHOUSE IT WAS NOW IN RUINS IVY GREW OVER THE SUBSTANTIAL WALLS THAT STILL REFITTED THE DEPREDATIONS OF TIME AND ALMOST CONCEALED A NOBLE ARCH ON WHICH MAIMED LIONS COUCHED AND VULTURES AND EAGLES WHO HAD LOST THEIR WINGS SEEMED TO REST FOR EVER THERE NEAR IT WAS A ROOKERY AND THE ROOKS LIVED SAFE IN THE HIGH TREES WHOSE TRUNKS WERE ALL COVERED WITH IVY OR MOSS AND A NUMBER OF FUNGUSSES GREW ABOUT THEIR LARGE ROOTS THE GRASS WAS LONG AND REMAINING UNDISTURBED SAVE WHEN THE WIND SWEPT ACROSS IT WAS OF COURSE PATHLESS HERE THE MOWER NEVER WHET HIS SCYTHE NOR DID THE HAYMAKERS MIX THEIR SONGS WITH THE HOARSE CROAKING OF THE ROOKS A SPACIOUS BASON ON THE MARGIN OF WHICH WATER PLANTS GREW WITH WILD LUXURIANCE WAS OVERSPREAD WITH SLIME AND AFFORDED A SHELTER FOR TOADS AND ADDERS IN MANY PLACES WERE HEAPED THE RUINS OF ORNAMENTAL BUILDINGS WHILST SUNDIALS RESTED IN THE SHADE AND PEDESTALS THAT HAD CRUSHED THE FIGURES THEY BEFORE SUPPORTED MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE GRASS THEY WOULD FREQUENTLY STUMBLE OVER A HEADLESS STATUE OR THE HEAD WOULD IMPEDE THEIR PROGRESS WHEN THEY SPOKE THE SOUND SEEMED TO RETURN AGAIN AS IF UNABLE TO PENETRATE THE THICK STAGNATED AIR THE SUN COULD NOT DART ITS PURIFYING RAYS THROUGH THE THICK GLOOM AND THE FALLEN LEAVES CONTRIBUTED TO CHOKE UP THE WAY AND RENDER THE AIR MORE NOXIOUS I BROUGHT YOU TO THIS PLACE ON PURPOSE THIS EVENING SAID MRS MASON TO THE CHILDREN WHO CLUNG ABOUT HER TO TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF THE LAST INHABITANT BUT AS THIS PART IS UNWHOLESOME WE WILL SIT ON THE BROKEN STONES OF THE DRAWBRIDGE CHARLES TOWNLEY WAS A BOY OF UNCOMMON ABILITIES AND STRONG FEELINGS BUT HE EVER PERMITTED THOSE FEELINGS TO DIRECT HIS CONDUCT WITHOUT SUBMITTING TO THE DIRECTION OF REASON I MEAN THE PRESENT EMOTION GOVERNED HIM HE HAD NOT ANY STRENGTH OR CONSISTENCY OF CHARACTER ONE MOMENT HE ENJOYED A PLEASURE AND THE NEXT FELT THE PANGS OF REMORSE ON ACCOUNT OF SOME DUTY WHICH HE HAD NEGLECTED HE ALWAYS INDEED INTENDED TO ACT RIGHT IN EVERY PARTICULAR TOMORROW BUT TODAY HE FOLLOWED THE PREVAILING WHIM HE HEARD BY CHANCE OF A MAN IN GREAT DISTRESS HE DETERMINED TO RELIEVE HIM AND LEFT HIS HOUSE IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE HUMANE IMPULSE BUT MEETING AN ACQUAINTANCE HE WAS PERSUADED TO GO TO THE PLAY AND TOMORROW HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DO THE ACT OF CHARITY THE NEXT MORNING SOME COMPANY CAME TO BREAKFAST WITH HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH THEM TO VIEW SOME FINE PICTURES IN THE EVENING HE WENT TO A CONCERT THE DAY FOLLOWING HE WAS TIRED AND LAID IN BED TILL NOON THEN READ A PATHETIC STORY WELL WROUGHT UP WEPT OVER ITFELL ASLEEPAND FORGOT TO ACT HUMANELY AN ACCIDENT REMINDED HIM OF HIS INTENTION HE SENT TO THE MAN AND FOUND THAT HE HAD TOO LONG DELAYEDTHE RELIEF WAS USELESS IN THIS THOUGHTLESS MANNER HE SPENT HIS TIME AND FORTUNE NEVER APPLYING TO ANY PROFESSION THOUGH FORMED TO SHINE IN ANY ONE HE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN HIS FRIENDS WERE OFFENDED AND AT LAST ALLOWED HIM TO LANGUISH IN A GAOL AND AS THERE APPEARED NO PROBABILITY OF REFORMING OR FIXING HIM THEY LEFT HIM TO STRUGGLE WITH ADVERSITY SEVERELY DID HE REPROACH HIMSELFHE WAS ALMOST LOST IN DESPAIR WHEN A FRIEND VISITED HIM THIS FRIEND LOVED THE LATENT SPARKS OF VIRTUE WHICH HE IMAGINED WOULD SOME TIME OR OTHER LIGHT UP AND ANIMATE HIS CONDUCT HE PAID HIS DEBTS AND GAVE HIM A SUM OF MONEY SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO PREPARE FOR A VOYAGE TO THE EAST INDIES WHERE CHARLES WISHED TO GO TO TRY TO REGAIN HIS LOST FORTUNE THROUGH THE INTERCESSION OF THIS KIND CONSIDERATE FRIEND HIS RELATIONS WERE RECONCILED TO HIM AND HIS SPIRITS RAISED HE SAILED WITH A FAIR WIND AND FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS MOST ROMANTIC WISHES IN THE SPACE OF FIFTEEN YEARS HE ACQUIRED A MUCH LARGER FORTUNE THAN HE HAD EVEN HOPED FOR AND THOUGHT OF VISITING NAY SETTLING IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE THOUGH IMPRESSED BY THE MOST LIVELY SENSE OF GRATITUDE HE HAD DROPPED HIS FRIENDS CORRESPONDENCE YET AS HE KNEW THAT HE HAD A DAUGHTER HIS FIRST DETERMINATION WAS TO RESERVE FOR HER THE GREATER PART OF HIS PROPERTY AS THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL PROOF WHICH HE COULD GIVE OF HIS GRATITUDETHE THOUGHT PLEASED HIM AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT TO DIVERT HIM FOR SOME MONTHS BUT ACCIDENTALLY HEARING THAT HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN VERY UNSUCCESSFUL IN TRADE THIS INFORMATION MADE HIM WISH TO HASTEN HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY STILL A PROCRASTINATING SPIRIT POSSESSED HIM AND HE DELAYED FROM TIME TO TIME THE ARDUOUS TASK OF SETTLING HIS AFFAIRS PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE HE WROTE HOWEVER TO ENGLAND AND TRANSMITTED A CONSIDERABLE SUM TO A CORRESPONDENT DESIRING THAT THIS HOUSE MIGHT BE PREPARED FOR HIM AND THE MORTGAGE CLEARED I CAN SCARCELY ENUMERATE THE VARIOUS DELAYS THAT PREVENTED HIS EMBARKING AND WHEN HE ARRIVED IN ENGLAND HE CAME HERE AND WAS SO CHILDISHLY EAGER TO HAVE HIS HOUSE FITTED UP WITH TASTE THAT HE ACTUALLY TRIFLED AWAY A MONTH BEFORE HE WENT TO SEEK FOR HIS FRIEND BUT HIS NEGLIGENCE WAS NOW SEVERELY PUNISHED HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN REDUCED TO GREAT DISTRESS AND THROWN INTO THE VERY GAOL OUT OF WHICH HE TOOK TOWNLEY WHO HASTENING TO IT ONLY FOUND HIS DEAD BODY THERE FOR HE DIED THE DAY BEFORE ON THE TABLE WAS LYING AMIDST SOME OTHER SCRAPS OF PAPER A LETTER DIRECTED IN AN UNSTEADY HAND TO CHARLES TOWNLEY HE TORE IT OPEN FEW WERE THE SCARCELY LEGIBLE LINES BUT THEY SMOTE HIS HEART HE READ AS FOLLOWS I HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY UNFORESEEN MISFORTUNES YET WHEN I HEARD OF YOUR ARRIVAL A GLEAM OF JOY CHEERED MY HEARTI THOUGHT I KNEW YOURS AND THAT MY LATTER DAYS MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN MADE COMFORTABLE IN YOUR SOCIETY FOR I LOVED YOU I EVEN EXPECTED PLEASURE BUT I WAS MISTAKEN DEATH IS MY ONLY FRIEND HE READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND CRIED OUT GRACIOUS GOD HAD I ARRIVED BUT ONE DAY SOONER I SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE DIED THINKING ME THE MOST UNGRATEFUL WRETCH THAT EVER BURDENED THE EARTH HE THEN KNOCKED HIS CLINCHED FIST AGAINST HIS FOREHEAD LOOKED WILDLY ROUND THE DREARY APARTMENT AND EXCLAIMED IN A CHOKED THOUGH IMPATIENT TONE YOU SAT HERE YESTERDAY THINKING OF MY INGRATITUDEWHERE ARE YOU NOW OH THAT I HAD SEEN YOU OH THAT MY REPENTING SIGHS COULD REACH YOU HE ORDERED THE BODY TO BE INTERRED AND RETURNED HOME A PREY TO GRIEF AND DESPONDENCY INDULGING IT TO EXCESS HE NEGLECTED TO ENQUIRE AFTER HIS FRIENDS DAUGHTER HE INTENDED TO PROVIDE AMPLY FOR HER BUT NOW HE COULD ONLY GRIEVE SOME TIME ELAPSED THEN HE SENT AND THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH HE PROCURED AGGRAVATED HIS DISTRESS AND GAVE IT A SEVERE ADDITIONAL STING THE POOR GENTLE GIRL HAD DURING HER FATHERS LIFE BEING ENGAGED TO A WORTHY YOUNG MAN BUT SOME TIME AFTER HIS DEATH THE RELATIONS OF HER LOVER HAD SENT HIM TO SEA TO PREVENT THE MATCH TAKING PLACE SHE WAS HELPLESS AND HAD NOT SUFFICIENT COURAGE TO COMBAT WITH POVERTY TO ESCAPE FROM IT SHE MARRIED AN OLD RAKE WHOM SHE DETESTED HE WAS ILLHUMOURED AND HIS VICIOUS HABITS RENDERED HIM A MOST DREADFUL COMPANION SHE TRIED IN VAIN TO PLEASE HIM AND BANISH THE SORROW THAT BENT HER DOWN AND MADE WEALTH AND ALL THE PLEASURES IT COULD PROCURE TASTELESS HER TENDER FATHER WAS DEADSHE HAD LOST HER LOVERWITHOUT A FRIEND OR CONFIDENT SILENT GRIEF CONSUMED HER I HAVE TOLD YOU FRIENDSHIP IS ONLY TO BE FOUND AMONGST THE VIRTUOUS HER HUSBAND WAS VICIOUS AH WHY DID SHE MARRY SAID MARY BECAUSE SHE WAS TIMID BUT I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU ALL THE GRIEF THAT DID NOT BREAK HER HEART DISTURBED HER REASON AND HER HUSBAND CONFINED HER IN A MADHOUSE CHARLES HEARD OF THIS LAST CIRCUMSTANCE HE VISITED HER FANNY SAID HE DO YOU RECOLLECT YOUR OLD FRIEND FANNY LOOKED AT HIM AND REASON FOR A MOMENT RESUMED HER SEAT AND INFORMED HER COUNTENANCE TO TRACE ANGUISH ON ITTHE TREMBLING LIGHT SOON DISAPPEAREDWILD FANCY FITTED IN HER EYES AND ANIMATED HER INCESSANT RANT SHE SUNG SEVERAL VERSES OF DIFFERENT SONGS TALKED OF HER HUSBANDS ILLUSAGEENQUIRED IF HE HAD LATELY BEEN TO SEA AND FREQUENTLY ADDRESSED HER FATHER AS IF HE WERE BEHIND HER CHAIR OR SITTING BY HER CHARLES COULD NOT BEAR THIS SCENEIF I COULD LOSE LIKE HER A SENSE OF WOE HE CRIED THIS INTOLERABLE ANGUISH WOULD NOT TEAR MY HEART THE FORTUNE WHICH HE HAD INTENDED FOR HER COULD NOT RESTORE HER REASON BUT HAD HE SENT FOR HER SOON AFTER HER FATHERS DEATH HE MIGHT HAVE SAVED HER AND COMFORTED HIMSELF THE LAST STROKE WAS WORSE THAN THE FIRST HE RETIRED TO THIS ABODE MELANCHOLY CREEPING ON HIM HE LET HIS BEARD GROW AND THE GARDEN RUN WILD ONE ROOM IN THE HOUSE THE POOR LUNATIC INHABITED AND HE HAD A PROPER PERSON TO ATTEND HER AND GUARD HER FROM THE DANGERS SHE WISHED TO ENCOUNTER EVERY DAY HE VISITED HER THE FIGHT OF HER WOULD ALMOST HAVE UNHINGED A SOUND MINDHOW COULD HE BEAR IT WHEN HIS CONSCIENCE REPROACHED HIM AND WHISPERED THAT HE HAD NEGLECTED TO DO GOOD TO LIVE TO ANY RATIONAL PURPOSETHE SWEETS OF FRIENDSHIP WERE DENIED AND HE EVERY DAY CONTEMPLATED THE SADDEST OF ALL SIGHTSTHE WRECK OF A HUMAN UNDERSTANDING HE DIED WITHOUT A WILL THE ESTATE WAS LITIGATED AND AS THE TITLE

CLEANING HER TEETH MRS MASON HAD OFTEN OBSERVED IT AND HINTED HER DISLIKE BUT UNWILLING TO BURDEN HER WITH PRECEPTS SHE WAITED FOR A GLARING EXAMPLE ONE WAS SOON ACCIDENTALLY THROWN IN HER WAY AND SHE DETERMINED THAT IT SHOULD NOT PASS UNOBSERVED A LADY WHO WAS REMARKABLE FOR HER NEGLIGENCE IN THIS RESPECT SPENT A WEEK WITH THEM AND DURING THAT TIME VERY FREQUENTLY DISCONCERTED THE CONOMY OF THE FAMILY SHE WAS SELDOM FIT TO BE SEEN AND IF ANY COMPANY CAME BY CHANCE TO DINNER SHE WOULD MAKE THEM WAIT TILL IT WAS QUITE COLD WHILST SHE HUDDLED ON SOME ILLCHOSEN FINERY IN THE SAME STYLE IF A LITTLE PARTY OF PLEASURE WAS PROPOSED SHE HAD TO DRESS HERSELF AND THE HURRY DISCOMPOSED HER AND TIRED THOSE WHO DID NOT LIKE TO LOSE TIME IN ANTICIPATING A TRIFLING AMUSEMENT A FEW HOURS AFTER SHE HAD LEFT THEM MRS MASON ENQUIRED OF MARY WHAT EFFECT THIS WEEKS EXPERIENCE HAD HAD ON HER MIND YOU ARE FOND OF RIDICULE CHILD BUT SELDOM IN THE RIGHT PLACE REAL CAUSE FOR IT YOU LET SLIP AND HEED NOT

FROM INDOLENCE HER MIND IS NOT EMPLOYED ABOUT MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE AND IF IT WERE IT WOULD NOT BE A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR HER HABITUALLY NEGLECTING AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A MANS AS WELL AS A WOMANS DUTY I SAID HABITUALLY GRIEF WILL OFTEN MAKE THOSE CARELESS WHO AT OTHER TIMES PAY A PROPER ATTENTION TO THEIR PERSON AND THIS NEGLECT IS A SURE INDICATION THAT THE CANKERWORM IS AT WORK AND WE OUGHT TO PITY RATHER THAN BLAME THE UNFORTUNATE INDEED WHEN PAINFUL ACTIVITY OF MIND OCCASIONS THIS INATTENTION IT WILL NOT LAST LONG THE SOUL STRUGGLES TO FREE ITSELF AND RETURN TO ITS USUAL TONE AND OLD HABITS THE LADY WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF EVER APPEARS A SLOVEN THOUGH SHE IS SOMETIMES A DISGUSTING FIGURE AND AT OTHERS A VERY TAUDRY FLIRT I CONTINUALLY CAUTION CAROLINE NOT TO SPEND MUCH TIME IN ADORNING HER PERSON BUT I NEVER DESIRED YOU TO NEGLECT YOURS WISDOM CONSISTS IN AVOIDING EXTREMESIMMODERATE FONDNESS FOR DRESS I TERM VANITY BUT A PROPER ATTENTION TO AVOID SINGULARITY DOES NOT DESERVE THAT NAME NEVER WASTE MUCH TIME ABOUT TRIFLES BUT THE TIME THAT IS NECESSARY EMPLOY PROPERLY EXERCISE YOUR UNDERSTANDING TASTE FLOWS FROM IT AND WILL IN A MOMENT DIRECT YOU IF YOU ARE NOT TOO SOLICITOUS TO CONFORM TO THE CHANGING FASHIONS AND LOITER AWAY IN LABORIOUS IDLENESS THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS WHEN THE IMAGINATION IS MOST LIVELY AND SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO FIX VIRTUOUS AFFECTIONS IN THE TENDER YOUTHFUL HEART OF ALL THE WOMEN WHOM I HAVE EVER MET WITH MRS TRUEMAN SEEMS THE FREEST FROM VANITY AND THOSE FRIVOLOUS VIEWS WHICH DEGRADE THE FEMALE CHARACTER HER VIRTUES CLAIM RESPECT AND THE PRACTICE OF THEM ENGROSSES HER THOUGHTS YET HER CLOTHES ARE APPARENTLY WELL CHOSEN AND YOU ALWAYS SEE HER IN THE SAME ATTIRE NOT LIKE MANY WOMEN WHO ARE EAGER TO SET OFF THEIR PERSONS TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE WHEN THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO TAKE A WALK AND ARE CARELESS NAY SLOVENLY WHEN FORCED TO STAY AT HOME MRS TRUEMANS CONDUCT IS JUST THE REVERSE SHE TRIES TO AVOID SINGULARITY FOR SHE DOES NOT WISH TO DISGUST THE GENERALITY BUT IT IS HER FAMILY HER FRIENDS WHOM SHE STUDIES TO PLEASE IN DRESS IT IS NOT LITTLE MINUTE THINGS BUT THE WHOLE THAT SHOULD BE ATTENDED TO AND THAT EVERY DAY AND THIS ATTENTION GIVES AN EASE TO THE PERSON BECAUSE THE CLOTHES APPEAR UNSTUDILY GRACEFUL NEVER CONTINUED MRS MASON DESIRE TO EXCEL IN TRIFLES IF YOU DO THERE IS AN END TO VIRTUOUS EMULATION THE MIND CANNOT ATTEND TO BOTH FOR WHEN THE MAIN PURSUIT IS TRIVIAL THE CHARACTER WILL OF COURSE BECOME INSIGNIFICANT HABITUAL NEATNESS IS LAUDABLE BUT IF YOU WISH TO BE RECKONED A WELL AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED GIRL AND FEEL THAT PRAISE ON ACCOUNT OF IT GIVES YOU PLEASURE YOU ARE VAIN AND A LAUDABLE AMBITION CANNOT DWELL WITH VANITY SERVANTS AND THOSE WOMEN WHOSE MINDS HAVE HAD A VERY LIMITED RANGE PLACE ALL THEIR HAPPINESS IN ORNAMENTS AND FREQUENTLY NEGLECT THE ONLY ESSENTIAL PART IN DRESSNEATNESS I HAVE NOT THE LEAST OBJECTION TO YOUR DRESSING ACCORDING TO YOUR AGE I RATHER ENCOURAGE IT BY ALLOWING YOU TO WEAR THE GAYEST COLOURS YET I INSIST ON SOME DEGREE OF UNIFORMITY AND THINK YOU TREAT ME DISRESPECTFULLY WHEN YOU APPEAR BEFORE ME AND HAVE FORGOTTEN TO DO WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE NEGLECTED AND WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I ALWAYS DRESS MYSELF BEFORE BREAKFAST AND EXPECT YOU TO FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE IF THERE IS NOT A SUFFICIENT AND OBVIOUS EXCUSE YOU MARY MISSED A PLEASANT AIRING YESTERDAY FOR IF YOU HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE RESPECT WHICH IS DUE TO ME AND HURRIED DOWN TO BREAKFAST IN A SLOVENLY MANNER I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU OUT WITH ME BUT I DID NOT CHOOSE TO WAIT TILL YOU WERE READY AS YOUR NOT BEING SO WAS ENTIRELY YOUR OWN FAULT FATHERS AND MEN IN GENERAL COMPLAIN OF THIS INATTENTION THEY HAVE ALWAYS TO WAIT FOR FEMALES LEARN TO AVOID THIS FAULT HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT IT MAY APPEAR IN YOUR EYES FOR THAT HABIT CANNOT BE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE THAT SOMETIMES WEAKENS ESTEEM WHEN WE FREQUENTLY MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR ANOTHER IN TRIFLING MATTERS NOTIONS OF INFERIORITY TAKE ROOT IN THE MIND AND TOO OFTEN PRODUCE CONTEMPT RESPECT FOR THE UNDERSTANDING MUST BE THE BASIS OF CONSTANCY THE TENDERNESS WHICH FLOWS FROM PITY IS LIABLE TO PERISH INSENSIBLY TO CONSUME ITSELFEVEN THE VIRTUES OF THE HEART WHEN THEY DEGENERATE INTO WEAKNESS SINK A CHARACTER IN OUR ESTIMATION BESIDES A KIND OF GROSS FAMILIARITY TAKES PLACE OF DECENT AFFECTION AND THE RESPECT WHICH ALONE CAN RENDER DOMESTIC INTIMACY A LASTING COMFORT IS LOST BEFORE WE ARE AWARE OF IT CHAP XII BEHAVIOUR TO SERVANTSTRUE DIGNITY OF CHARACTER THE CHILDREN NOT COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST ONE MORNING AT THE USUAL TIME MRS MASON WENT HERSELF TO ENQUIRE THE REASON AND AS SHE ENTERED THE APARTMENT HEARD MARY SAY TO THE MAID WHO ASSISTED HER I WONDER AT YOUR IMPERTINENCE TO TALK THUS TO MEDO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE SPEAKING TOSHE WAS GOING ON BUT MRS MASON INTERRUPTED HER AND ANSWERED THE QUESTIONTO A LITTLE GIRL WHO IS ONLY ASSISTED BECAUSE SHE IS WEAK MARY SHRUNK BACK ABASHED AND MRS MASON CONTINUED AS YOU HAVE TREATED BETTY WHO IS TEN YEARS OLDER THAN YOURSELF IMPROPERLY YOU MUST NOW DO EVERY THING FOR YOURSELF AND AS YOU WILL BE SOME TIME ABOUT IT CAROLINE AND I WILL EAT OUR BREAKFAST AND VISIT MRS TRUEMAN BY THE TIME WE RETURN YOU MAY PERHAPS HAVE RECOLLECTED THAT CHILDREN ARE INFERIOR TO SERVANTS WHO ACT FROM THE DICTATES OF REASON AND WHOSE UNDERSTANDINGS ARE ARRIVED AT SOME DEGREE OF MATURITY WHILE CHILDREN MUST BE GOVERNED AND DIRECTED TILL THEIRS GAINS STRENGTH TO WORK BY ITSELF FOR IT IS THE PROPER EXERCISE OF OUR REASON THAT MAKES US IN ANY DEGREE INDEPENDENT WHEN MRS MASON RETURNED SHE MILDLY ADDRESSED MARY I HAVE OFTEN TOLD YOU THAT EVERY DISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE TENDED TO OUR IMPROVEMENT IF WE DO NOT PERVERSELY ACT CONTRARY TO OUR INTEREST ONE BEING IS MADE DEPENDENT ON ANOTHER THAT LOVE AND FORBEARANCE MAY SOFTEN THE HUMAN HEART AND THAT LINKED TOGETHER BY NECESSITY AND THE EXERCISE OF THE SOCIAL AFFECTIONS THE WHOLE FAMILY ON EARTH MIGHT HAVE A FELLOWFEELING FOR EACH OTHER BY THESE MEANS WE IMPROVE ONE ANOTHER BUT THERE IS NO REAL INFERIORITY YOU HAVE READ THE FABLE OF THE HEAD SUPPOSING ITSELF SUPERIOR TO THE REST OF THE MEMBERS THOUGH ALL ARE EQUALLY NECESSARY TO THE SUPPORT OF LIFE IF I BEHAVE IMPROPERLY TO SERVANTS I AM REALLY THEIR INFERIOR AS I ABUSE A TRUST AND IMITATE NOT THE BEING WHOSE SERVANT I AM WITHOUT A SHADOW OF EQUALITY CHILDREN ARE HELPLESS I ORDER MY SERVANTS TO WAIT ON YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BUT I HAVE NOT AS MUCH RESPECT FOR YOU AS FOR THEM YOU MAY POSSIBLY BECOME A VIRTUOUS CHARACTERMANY OF MY SERVANTS ARE REALLY SO ALREADY THEY HAVE DONE THEIR DUTY FILLED AN HUMBLE STATION AS THEY OUGHT TO FILL IT CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND DO YOU DARE TO DESPISE THOSE WHOM YOUR CREATOR APPROVES BEFORE THE GREATEST EARTHLY BEINGS I SHOULD NOT BE AWED THEY ARE MY FELLOW SERVANTS AND THOUGH SUPERIOR IN RANK WHICH LIKE PERSONAL BEAUTY ONLY DAZZLES THE VULGAR YET I MAY POSSESS MORE KNOWLEDGE AND VIRTUE THE SAME FEELING ACTUATES ME WHEN I AM IN COMPANY WITH THE POOR WE ARE CREATURES OF THE SAME NATURE AND I MAY BE THEIR INFERIOR IN THOSE GRACES WHICH SHOULD ADORN MY SOUL AND RENDER ME TRULY GREAT HOW OFTEN MUST I REPEAT TO YOU THAT A CHILD IS INFERIOR TO A MAN BECAUSE REASON IS IN ITS INFANCY AND IT IS REASON WHICH EXALTS A MAN ABOVE A BRUTE AND THE CULTIVATION OF IT RAISES THE WISE MAN ABOVE THE IGNORANT FOR WISDOM IS ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR VIRTUE THIS MORNING WHEN I ENTERED YOUR APARTMENT I HEARD YOU INSULT A WORTHY SERVANT YOU HAD JUST SAID YOUR PRAYERS BUT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY THE GABBLE OF THE TONGUE YOUR HEART WAS NOT ENGAGED IN THE SACRED EMPLOYMENT OR YOU COULD NOT SO SOON HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT YOU WERE A WEAK DEPENDENT BEING AND THAT YOU WERE TO RECEIVE MERCY AND KINDNESS ONLY ON THE CONDITION OF YOUR PRACTISING THE SAME I ADVISE YOU TO ASK BETTY TO PARDON YOUR IMPERTINENCE TILL YOU DO SO SHE SHALL NOT ASSIST YOU YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF VERY HELPLESS WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF MEN AND WOMENUNABLE TO COOK YOUR MEAT BAKE YOUR BREAD WASH YOUR CLOTHES OR EVEN PUT THEM ONSUCH A HELPLESS CREATURE IS A CHILDI KNOW WHAT YOU ARE YOU PERCEIVE MARY SUBMITTED AND IN FUTURE AFTER SHE SAID HER PRAYERS REMEMBERED THAT SHE WAS TO ENDEAVOUR TO CURB HER TEMPER CHAP XIII EMPLOYMENTIDLENESS PRODUCES MISERYTHE CULTIVATION OF THE FANCY RAISES US ABOVE THE VULGAR EXTENDS OUR HAPPINESS AND LEADS TO VIRTUE ONE AFTERNOON MRS MASON GAVE THE CHILDREN LEAVE TO AMUSE THEMSELVES BUT A KIND OF LISTLESSNESS HUNG OVER THEM AND AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO THEY SEEMED FATIGUED WITH DOING NOTHING THEY EAT CAKES THOUGH THEY HAD JUST DINED AND DID MANY FOOLISH THINGS MERELY BECAUSE THEY WERE IDLE THEIR FRIEND SEEING THAT THEY WERE IRRESOLUTE AND COULD NOT FIX ON ANY EMPLOYMENT REQUESTED CAROLINE TO ASSIST HER TO MAKE SOME CLOTHES THAT A POOR WOMAN WAS IN WANT OF AND WHILE WE ARE AT WORK SHE ADDED MARY WILL READ US AN ENTERTAINING TALE WHICH I WILL POINT OUT THE TALE INTERESTED THE CHILDREN WHO CHEARFULLY ATTENDED AND AFTER IT WAS FINISHED MRS MASON TOLD THEM THAT AS SHE HAD SOME LETTERS TO WRITE SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER ACCUSTOMED WALK BUT THAT SHE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO REPRESENT HER AND ACT FOR ONCE LIKE WOMEN THEY RECEIVED THEIR COMMISSION IT WAS TO TAKE THE CLOTHES TO THE POOR WOMAN WHOM THEY WERE INTENDED FOR LEARN HER PRESENT WANTS EXERCISE THEIR OWN JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE IMMEDIATE RELIEF SHE STOOD IN NEED OF AND ACT ACCORDINGLY THEY RETURNED HOME DELIGHTED EAGER TO TELL WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND HOW THANKFUL AND HAPPY THEY HAD LEFT THE POOR WOMAN OBSERVE NOW SAID MRS MASON THE ADVANTAGES ARISING FROM EMPLOYMENT THREE HOURS AGO YOU WERE UNCOMFORTABLE WITHOUT BEING SENSIBLE OF THE CAUSE AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO WITH YOURSELVES NAY YOU ACTUALLY COMMITTED A SIN FOR YOU DEVOURED CAKES WITHOUT FEELING HUNGER MERELY TO KILL TIME WHILST MANY POOR PEOPLE HAVE NOT THE MEANS OF SATISFYING THEIR NATURAL WANTS WHEN I DESIRED YOU TO READ TO ME YOU WERE AMUSED AND NOW YOU HAVE BEEN USEFUL YOU ARE DELIGHTED RECOLLECT THIS IN FUTURE WHEN YOU ARE AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO WITH YOURSELVES AND REMEMBER THAT IDLENESS MUST ALWAYS BE INTOLERABLE BECAUSE IT IS ONLY AN IRKSOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE EVERY GIFT OF HEAVEN IS LENT TO US FOR OUR IMPROVEMENT FANCY IS ONE OF THE FIRST OF THE INFERIOR ONES IN CULTIVATING IT WE ACQUIRE WHAT IS CALLED TASTE OR A RELISH FOR PARTICULAR EMPLOYMENTS WHICH OCCUPY OUR LEISURE HOURS AND RAISE US ABOVE THE VULGAR IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THOSE WHO HAVE NOT ANY TASTE TALK ALWAYS OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS OR OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS EVERY TRIVIAL MATTER THAT OCCURS WITHIN THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEY CANVASS AND CONJECTURE ABOUTNOT SO MUCH OUT OF ILLNATURE AS IDLENESS JUST AS YOU EAT THE CAKES WITHOUT THE IMPULSE OF HUNGER IN THE SAME STYLE PEOPLE TALK OF EATING AND DRESS AND LONG FOR THEIR MEALS MERELY TO DIVIDE THE DAY BECAUSE THE INTERMEDIATE TIME IS NOT EMPLOYED IN A MORE INTERESTING MANNER EVERY NEW BRANCH OF TASTE THAT WE CULTIVATE AFFORDS US A REFUGE FROM IDLENESS A FORTRESS IN WHICH WE MAY RESIST THE ASSAULTS OF VICE AND THE MORE NOBLE OUR EMPLOYMENTS THE MORE EXALTED WILL OUR MINDS BECOME MUSIC DRAWING WORKS OF USEFULNESS AND FANCY ALL AMUSE AND REFINE THE MIND SHARPEN THE INGENUITY AND FORM INSENSIBLY THE DAWNING JUDGMENT AS THE JUDGMENT GAINS STRENGTH SO DO THE PASSIONS ALSO WE HAVE ACTIONS TO WEIGH AND NEED THAT TASTE IN CONDUCT THAT DELICATE SENSE OF PROPRIETY WHICH GIVES GRACE TO VIRTUE THE HIGHEST BRANCH OF SOLITARY AMUSEMENT IS READING BUT EVEN IN THE CHOICE OF BOOKS THE FANCY IS FIRST EMPLOYED FOR IN READING THE HEART IS TOUCHED TILL ITS FEELINGS ARE EXAMINED BY THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE RIPENINGS OF REASON REGULATE THE IMAGINATION THIS IS THE WORK OF YEARS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL EMPLOYMENTS WHEN LIFE ADVANCES IF THE HEART HAS BEEN CAPABLE OF RECEIVING EARLY IMPRESSIONS AND THE HEAD OF REASONING AND RETAINING THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH WERE DRAWN FROM THEM WE HAVE ACQUIRED A STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE A GOLD MINE WHICH WE CAN OCCASIONALLY RECUR TO INDEPENDENT OF OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES THE SUPREME BEING HAS EVERY THING IN HIMSELF WE PROCEED FROM HIM AND OUR KNOWLEDGE AND AFFECTIONS MUST RETURN TO HIM FOR EMPLOYMENT SUITED TO THEM AND THOSE WHO MOST RESEMBLE HIM OUGHT NEXT TO HIM TO BE THE OBJECTS OF OUR LOVE AND THE BEINGS WHOM WE SHOULD TRY TO ASSOCIATE WITH THAT WE MAY RECEIVE AN INFERIOR DEGREE OF SATISFACTION FROM THEIR SOCIETY BUT BE ASSURED OUR CHIEF COMFORT MUST EVER ARISE FROM THE MINDS REVIEWING ITS OWN OPERATIONSAND THE WHISPERS OF AN APPROVING CONSCIENCE TO CONVINCE US THAT LIFE HAS NOT SLIPPED AWAY UNEMPLOYED CHAP XIV INNOCENT AMUSEMENTSDESCRIPTION OF A WELSH CASTLEHISTORY OF A WELSH HARPERA TYRANNICAL LANDLORDFAMILY PRIDE AS IT WAS NOW HARVEST TIME THE NEW SCENE AND THE FINE WEATHER DELIGHTED THE CHILDREN WHO RAN CONTINUALLY OUT TO VIEW THE REAPERS INDEED EVERY THING SEEMED TO WEAR A FACE OF FESTIVITY AND THE RIPE CORN BENT UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT OR MORE ERECT SHEWED THE LAUGHING APPEARANCE OF PLENTY MRS MASON ALWAYS ALLOWING THE GLEANERS TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY A GREAT NUMBER OF POOR CAME TO GATHER A LITTLE HARVEST AND SHE WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE FEEBLE HANDS OF CHILDHOOD AND AGE COLLECTING THE SCATTERED EARS HONEST JACK CAME WITH HIS FAMILY AND WHEN THE LABOURS OF THE DAY WERE OVER WOULD PLAY ON A FIDDLE THAT FREQUENTLY HAD BUT THREE STRINGS BUT IT SERVED TO SET THE FEET IN MOTION AND THE LADS AND LASSES DANCING ON THE GREEN SOD SUFFERED EVERY CARE TO SLEEP AN OLD WELSH HARPER GENERALLY CAME TO THE HOUSE ABOUT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR AND STAID A MONTH OR MORE FOR MRS MASON WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS INSTRUMENT AND INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF THE PLAYER AS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN WE HAVE RESCUED A PERSON OUT OF ANY DISTRESS SHE INFORMED THE CHILDREN THAT ONCE TRAVELLING THROUGH WALES HER CARRIAGE WAS OVERTURNED NEAR THE RUINS OF AN OLD CASTLE AND AS SHE HAD ESCAPED UNHURT SHE DETERMINED TO WANDER AMONGST THEM WHILST THE DRIVER TOOK CARE OF HIS HORSES AND HER SERVANT HASTENED TO THE NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE FOR ASSISTANCE IT WAS ALMOST DARK AND THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE IN THE SCATTERED COTTAGES THE SCENE PLEASED ME CONTINUED MRS MASON I THOUGHT OF THE VARIOUS CUSTOMS WHICH THE LAPSE OF TIME UNFOLDS AND DWELT ON THE STATE OF THE WELSH WHEN THIS CASTLE NOW SO DESOLATE WAS THE HOSPITABLE ABODE OF THE CHIEF OF A NOBLE FAMILY THESE REFLECTIONS ENTIRELY ENGROSSED MY MIND WHEN THE SOUND OF A HARP REACHED MY EARS NEVER WAS ANY THING MORE OPPORTUNE THE NATIONAL MUSIC SEEMED TO GIVE REALITY TO THE PICTURES WHICH MY IMAGINATION HAD BEEN DRAWING I LISTENED AWHILE AND THEN TRYING TO TRACE THE PLEASING SOUND DISCOVERED AFTER A SHORT SEARCH A LITTLE HUT RUDELY BUILT THE WALLS OF AN OLD TOWER SUPPORTED PART OF THE THATCH WHICH SCARCELY KEPT OUT THE RAIN AND THE TWO OTHER SIDES WERE STONES CEMENTED OR RATHER PLAISTERED TOGETHER BY MUD AND CLAY I ENTERED AND BEHELD AN OLD MAN SITTING BY A FEW LOOSE STICKS WHICH BLAZED ON THE HEARTH AND A YOUNG WOMAN WITH ONE CHILD AT HER BREAST SUCKING AND ANOTHER ON HER KNEE NEAR THEM STOOD A COW AND HER CALF THE MAN HAD BEEN PLAYING ON THE HARP HE ROSE WHEN HE SAW ME AND OFFERED HIS CHAIR THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN ON A LARGE CHEST IN THE CHIMNEYCORNER WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT ALL THE LIGHT THAT WAS ADMITTED CAME THROUGH THE HOLE CALLED A CHIMNEY AND DID NOT MUCH ENLIVEN THE DWELLING I MENTIONED MY ACCIDENT TO ACCOUNT FOR MY INTRUSION AND REQUESTED THE HARPER AGAIN TO TOUCH THE INSTRUMENT THAT HAD ATTRACTED ME A PARTITION OF TWIGS AND DRIED LEAVES DIVIDED THIS APARTMENT FROM ANOTHER IN WHICH I PERCEIVED A LIGHT I ENQUIRED ABOUT IT AND THE WOMAN IN AN ARTLESS MANNER INFORMED ME THAT SHE HAD LET IT TO A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN LATELY MARRIED WHO WAS RELATED TO A VERY GOOD FAMILY AND WOULD NOT LODGE ANY WHERE OR WITH ANY BODY THIS INTELLIGENCE MADE ME SMILE TO THINK THAT FAMILY PRIDE SHOULD BE A SOLACE IN SUCH EXTREME POVERTY I SAT THERE SOME TIME AND THEN THE HARPER ACCOMPANIED ME TO SEE WHETHER THE CARRIAGE WAS REPAIRED I FOUND IT WAITING FOR ME AND AS THE INN I WAS TO SLEEP AT WAS ONLY ABOUT TWO MILES FURTHER THE HARPER OFFERED TO COME AND PLAY TO ME WHILST I WAS EATING MY SUPPER THIS WAS JUST WHAT I WISHED FOR HIS APPEARANCE HAD ROUSED MY COMPASSION AS WELL AS MY CURIOSITY AND I TOOK HIM AND HIS HARP IN THE CHAISE AFTER SUPPER HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD ONCE A VERY GOOD FARM BUT HE HAD BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO DISPLEASE THE JUSTICE WHO NEVER FORGAVE HIM NOR RESTED TILL HE HAD RUINED HIM THIS TYRANT ALWAYS EXPECTED HIS TENANTS TO ASSIST HIM TO BRING IN HIS HARVEST BEFORE THEY HAD GOT IN THEIR OWN THE POOR HARPER WAS ONCE IN THE MIDST OF HIS WHEN AN ORDER WAS SENT TO HIM TO BRING HIS CARTS AND SERVANTS THE NEXT DAY TO THE FIELDS OF THIS PETTY KING HE FOOLISHLY REFUSED AND THIS REFUSAL WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THAT SETTLED HATRED WHICH PRODUCED SUCH FATAL CONSEQUENCES AH MADAM SAID THE SUFFERER YOUR HEART WOULD ACHE IF YOU HEARD OF ALL HIS CRUELTIES TO ME AND THE REST OF HIS POOR TENANTS HE EMPLOYS MANY LABOURERS AND WILL NOT GIVE THEM AS MUCH WAGES AS THEY COULD GET FROM THE COMMON FARMERS YET THEY DARE NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE TO WORK WHEN HE SENDS FOR THEM THE FISH THAT THEY CATCH THEY MUST BRING FIRST TO HIM OR THEY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WALK OVER HIS GROUNDS TO CATCH THEM AND HE WILL GIVE JUST WHAT HE PLEASES FOR THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF THEIR PANNIER BUT THERE WOULD BE NO END TO MY STORY WERE I TO TELL YOU OF ALL HIS OPPRESSIONS I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE MY FARM AND MY DAUGHTER WHOM YOU SAW THIS EVENING HAVING MARRIED

TUNE WHILE HE WAS STRIKING THE STRINGS I THOUGHT TOO OF THE CHANGES IN LIFE WHICH AN AGE HAD PRODUCED THE DESCENDANT OF THOSE WHO HAD MADE THE HALL RING WITH SOCIAL MIRTH NOW MOURNED IN ITS RUINS AND HUNG HIS HARP ON THE MOULDERING BATTLEMENTS SUCH IS THE FATE OF BUILDINGS AND OF FAMILIES AFTER I HAD DISMISSED MY GUEST I SENT FOR THE LANDLORD TO MAKE SOME FARTHER ENQUIRIES AND FOUND THAT I HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED I THEN DETERMINED TO ASSIST HIM AND THOUGHT MY ACCIDENT PROVIDENTIAL I KNEW A MAN OF CONSEQUENCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I VISITED HIM AND EXERTED MYSELF TO PROCURE THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE YOUNG MAN I SUCCEEDED AND NOT ONLY RESTORED HIM TO HIS FAMILY BUT PREVAILED ON MY FRIEND TO LET HIM RENT A SMALL FARM ON HIS ESTATE AND I GAVE HIM MONEY TO BUY STOCK FOR IT AND THE IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY THE OLD HARPERS GRATITUDE WAS UNBOUNDED THE SUMMER AFTER HE WALKED TO VISIT ME AND EVER SINCE HE HAS CONTRIVED TO COME EVERY YEAR TO ENLIVEN OUR HARVESTHOME THIS EVENING IT IS TO BE CELEBRATED THE EVENING CAME THE JOYOUS PARTY FOOTED IT AWAY MERRILY AND THE SOUND OF THEIR SHOES WAS HEARD ON THE BARNFLOOR IT WAS NOT THE LIGHT FANTASTIC TOE THAT FASHION TAUGHT TO MOVE BUT HONEST HEARTFELT MIRTH AND THE LOUD LAUGH IF IT SPOKE THE VACANT HEAD SAID AUDIBLY THAT THE HEART WAS GUILELESS MRS MASON ALWAYS GAVE THEM SOME TRIFLING PRESENTS AT THIS TIME TO RENDER THE APPROACH OF WINTER MORE COMFORTABLE TO THE MEN SHE GENERALLY PRESENTED WARM CLOTHING AND TO THE WOMEN FLAX AND WORSTED FOR KNITTING AND SPINNING AND THOSE WHO WERE THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS RECEIVED A REWARD WHEN THE NEW YEAR COMMENCED THE CHILDREN HAD BOOKS GIVEN TO THEM AND LITTLE ORNAMENTSALL WERE ANXIOUS FOR THE DAY AND RECEIVED THEIR OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE HARPER WITH THE MOST CORDIAL SMILES CHAP XV PRAYERA MOONLIGHT SCENERESIGNATION THE HARPER WOULD FREQUENTLY SIT UNDER A LARGER ELM A FEW PACES FROM THE HOUSE AND PLAY SOME OF THE MOST PLAINTIVE WELSH TUNES WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE EATING THEIR SUPPER MRS MASON DESIRED HIM TO PLAY HER SOME FAVOURITE AIRS AND SHE AND THE CHILDREN WALKED ROUND THE TREE UNDER WHICH HE SAT ON THE STUMP OF ANOTHER THE MOON ROSE IN CLOUDLESS MAJESTY AND A NUMBER OF STARS TWINKLED NEAR HER THE SOFTENED LANDSCAPE INSPIRED TRANQUILLITY WHILE THE STRAIN OF RUSTIC MELODY GAVE A PLEASING MELANCHOLY TO THE WHOLE AND MADE THE TEAR START WHOSE SOURCE COULD SCARCELY BE TRACED THE PLEASURE THE SIGHT OF HARMLESS MIRTH GAVE RISE TO IN MRS MASONS BOSOM ROUSED EVERY TENDER FEELING AND SET IN MOTION HER SPIRITS SHE LAUGHED WITH THE POOR WHOM SHE HAD MADE HAPPY AND WEPT WHEN SHE RECOLLECTED HER OWN SORROWS THE ILLUSIONS OF YOUTHTHE GAY EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD FORMERLY CLIPPED THE WINGS OF TIME SHE TURNED TO THE GIRLSI HAVE BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE MY YOUNG FRIENDS BUT MY GRIEFS ARE NOW OF A PLACID KIND HEAVY MISFORTUNES HAVE OBSCURED THE SUN I GAZED AT WHEN FIRST I ENTERED LIFE EARLY ATTACHMENTS HAVE BEEN BROKEN THE DEATH OF FRIENDS I LOVED HAS SO CLOUDED MY DAYS THAT NEITHER THE BEAMS OF PROSPERITY NOR EVEN THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE CAN DISSIPATE THE GLOOM BUT I AM NOT LOST IN A THICK FOG MY STATE OF MIND RATHER RESEMBLES THE SCENE BEFORE YOU IT IS QUIET I AM WEANED FROM THE WORLD BUT NOT DISGUSTED FOR I CAN STILL DO GOOD AND IN FUTURITY A SUN WILL RISE TO CHEAR MY HEART BEYOND THE NIGHT OF DEATH I HAIL THE DAWN OF AN ETERNAL DAY I MENTION MY STATE OF MIND TO YOU THAT I MAY TELL YOU WHAT SUPPORTS ME THE FESTIVITY WITHIN AND THE PLACIDITY WITHOUT LED MY THOUGHTS NATURALLY TO THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE MY COMFORT SPRINGSTO THE GREAT BESTOWER OF EVERY BLESSING PRAYER MY CHILDREN IS THE DEAREST PRIVILEGE OF MAN AND THE SUPPORT OF A FEELING HEART MINE HAS TOO OFTEN BEEN WOUNDED BY INGRATITUDE MY FELLOWCREATURES WHOM I HAVE FONDLY LOVED HAVE NEGLECTED MEI HAVE HEARD THEIR LAST SIGH AND THROWN MY EYES ROUND AN EMPTY WORLD BUT THEN MORE PARTICULARLY FEELING THE PRESENCE OF MY CREATOR I POURED OUT MY SOUL BEFORE HIM AND WAS NO LONGER ALONE I NOW DAILY CONTEMPLATE HIS WONDERFUL GOODNESS AND THOUGH AT AN AWFUL DISTANCE TRY TO IMITATE HIM THIS VIEW OF THINGS IS A SPUR TO ACTIVITY AND A CONSOLATION IN DISAPPOINTMENT THERE IS IN FACT A CONSTANT INTERCOURSE KEPT UP WITH THE CREATOR WHEN WE LEARN TO CONSIDER HIM AS THE FOUNTAIN OF TRUTH WHICH OUR UNDERSTANDING NATURALLY THIRSTS AFTER BUT HIS GOODNESS BRINGS HIM STILL MORE ON A LEVEL WITH OUR BOUNDED CAPACITIES FOR WE TRACE IT IN EVERY WORK OF MERCY AND FEEL IN SORROW PARTICULARLY HIS FATHERLY CARE EVERY BLESSING IS DOUBLED WHEN WE SUPPOSE IT COMES FROM HIM AND AFFLICTIONS ALMOST LOSE THEIR NAME WHEN WE BELIEVE THEY ARE SENT TO CORRECT NOT CRUSH US WHILST WE ARE ALIVE TO GRATITUDE AND ADMIRATION WE MUST ADORE GOD THE HUMAN SOUL IS SO FRAMED THAT GOODNESS AND TRUTH MUST FILL IT WITH INEFFABLE PLEASURE AND THE NEARER IT APPROACHES TO PERFECTION THE MORE EARNESTLY WILL IT PURSUE THOSE VIRTUES DISCERNING MORE CLEARLY THEIR BEAUTY THE SUPREME BEING DWELLS IN THE UNIVERSE HE IS AS ESSENTIALLY PRESENT TO THE WICKED AS TO THE GOOD BUT THE LATTER DELIGHT IN HIS PRESENCE AND TRY TO PLEASE HIM WHILST THE FORMER SHRINK FROM A JUDGE WHO IS OF TOO PURE A NATURE TO BEHOLD INIQUITY THE WICKED WISH FOR THE ROCKS TO COVER THEM MOUNTAINS OR THE ANGRY SEA WHICH WE THE OTHER DAY SURVEYED TO HIDE THEM FROM THE PRESENCE OF THAT BEING IN WHOSE PRESENCE ONLY THEY COULD FIND JOY YOU FEEL EMOTIONS THAT INCITE YOU TO DO GOOD AND PAINFUL ONES DISTURB YOU WHEN YOU HAVE RESISTED THE FAITHFUL INTERNAL MONITOR THE WISER AND THE BETTER YOU GROW THE MORE VISIBLE IF I MAY USE THE EXPRESSION WILL GOD BECOME FOR WISDOM CONSISTS IN SEARCHING HIM OUT AND GOODNESS IN ENDEAVOURING TO COPY HIS ATTRIBUTES TO ATTAIN ANY THING GREAT A MODEL MUST BE HELD UP TO EXERCISE OUR UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGE OUR AFFECTIONS A VIEW OF THE DISINTERESTED GOODNESS OF GOD IS THEREFORE CALCULATED TO TOUCH US MORE THAN CAN BE CONCEIVED BY A DEPRAVED MIND WHEN THE LOVE OF GOD IS SHED ABROAD IN OUR HEARTS TRUE COURAGE WILL ANIMATE OUR CONDUCT FOR NOTHING CAN HURT THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM IF THE DESIRE OF ACTING RIGHT IS EVER PRESENT WITH US IF ADMIRATION OF GOODNESS FILLS OUR SOULS WE MAY BE SAID TO PRAY CONSTANTLY AND IF WE TRY TO DO JUSTICE TO ALL OUR FELLOWCREATURES AND EVEN TO THE BRUTE CREATION AND ASSIST THEM AS FAR AS WE CAN WE PROVE WHOSE SERVANTS WE ARE AND WHOSE LAWS WE TRANSCRIBE IN OUR LIVES NEVER BE VERY ANXIOUS WHEN YOU PRAY WHAT WORDS TO USE REGULATE YOUR THOUGHTS AND RECOLLECT THAT VIRTUE CALMS THE PASSIONS GIVES CLEARNESS TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND OPENS IT TO PLEASURES THAT THE THOUGHTLESS AND VICIOUS HAVE NOT A GLIMPSE OF YOU MUST BELIEVE ME BE ACQUAINTED WITH GOD TO FIND PEACE TO RISE SUPERIOR TO WORLDLY TEMPTATIONS HABITUAL DEVOTION IS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO OUR HAPPINESS AS WHAT OFTENEST OCCUPIES THE THOUGHTS WILL INFLUENCE OUR ACTIONS BUT OBSERVE WHAT I SAYTHAT DEVOTION IS MOCKERY AND SELFISHNESS WHICH DOES NOT IMPROVE OUR MORAL CHARACTER MEN OF OLD PRAYED TO THE DEVIL SACRIFICED THEIR CHILDREN TO HIM AND COMMITTED EVERY KIND OF BARBARITY AND IMPURITY BUT WE WHO SERVE A LONGSUFFERING GOD SHOULD PITY THE WEAKNESS OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES WE MUST NOT BEG FOR MERCY AND NOT SHEW IT WE MUST NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE OFFENDED WITHOUT TRYING TO AVOID DOING SO IN FUTURE WE ARE TO DEAL WITH OUR FELLOWCREATURES AS WE EXPECT TO BE DEALT WITH THIS IS PRACTICAL PRAYERTHOSE WHO PRACTICE IT FEEL FREQUENTLY SUBLIME PLEASURES AND LIVELY HOPES ANIMATE THEM IN THIS VALE OF TEARS THAT SEEM A FORETASTE OF THE FELICITY THEY WILL ENJOY WHEN THE UNDERSTANDING IS MORE ENLIGHTENED AND THE AFFECTIONS PROPERLY REGULATED TOMORROW I WILL TAKE YOU TO VISIT THE SCHOOLMISTRESS OF THE VILLAGE AND RELATE HER STORY TO ENFORCE WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING NOW YOU MAY GO AND DANCE ONE OR TWO DANCES AND I WILL JOIN YOU AFTER I HAVE TAKEN A WALK WHICH I WISH TO ENJOY ALONE CHAP XVI THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM DEVOTIONTHE HISTORY OF THE VILLAGE SCHOOLMISTRESSFATAL EFFECTS OF INATTENTION TO EXPENCES IN THE HISTORY OF MR LOFTY THE NEXT MORNING MRS MASON DESIRED THE CHILDREN TO GET THEIR WORK AND DRAW NEAR THE TABLE WHILST SHE RELATED THE PROMISED HISTORY AND IN THE AFTERNOON IF THE WEATHER BE FINE THEY WERE TO VISIT THE VILLAGE SCHOOLMISTRESS HER FATHER THE HONOURABLE MR LOFTY WAS THE YOUNGEST SON OF A NOBLE FAMILY HIS EDUCATION HAD BEEN LIBERAL THOUGH HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS RELATIONS HOWEVER SEEMED DETERMINED TO PUSH HIM FORWARD IN LIFE BEFORE HE DISOBLIGED THEM BY MARRYING THE DAUGHTER OF A COUNTRY CLERGYMAN AN ACCOMPLISHED SENSIBLE WOMAN SOME TIME AFTER THE BIRTH OF HIS DAUGHTER ANNA HIS ELDER BROTHER THE EARL OF CAERMARTHEN WAS RECONCILED TO HIM BUT THIS RECONCILIATION ONLY LED HIM INTO EXPENCES WHICH HIS LIMITED FORTUNE COULD NOT BEAR MR LOFTY HAD A HIGH SENSE OF HONOUR AND RATHER A PROFUSE TURN HE WAS BESIDE A VERY HUMANE MAN AND GAVE AWAY MUCH MORE THAN HE COULD AFFORD TO GIVE WHEN HIS COMPASSION WAS EXCITED HE NEVER DID A MEAN ACTION BUT SOMETIMES AN OSTENTATIOUS PRIDE TARNISHED THE LUSTRE OF VERY SPLENDID ONES AND MADE THEM APPEAR TO JUDICIOUS EYES MORE LIKE TINSEL THAN GOLD I WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT HIS FIRST IMPULSE AROSE FROM SENSIBILITY AND THE SECOND FROM AN IMMODERATE DESIRE OF HUMAN APPLAUSE FOR HE SEEMED NOT TO BE ALIVE TO DEVOTIONAL FEELINGS OR TO HAVE THAT ROCK TO REST ON WHICH WILL SUPPORT A FRAIL BEING AND GIVE TRUE DIGNITY TO A CHARACTER THOUGH ALL NATURE COMBINED TO CRUSH IT MRS LOFTY WAS NOT A SHINING CHARACTERBUT I WILL READ YOU A PART OF A LETTER WHICH HER DAUGHTER THE LADY WE ARE TO VISIT WROTE TO ME THIS BEING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY ON WHICH AN EVER LOVED AND MUCH REVERED PARENT WAS RELEASED FROM THE BONDAGE OF MORTALITY I OBSERVE IT WITH PARTICULAR SERIOUSNESS AND WITH GRATITUDE FOR HER SORROWS WERE GREAT HER TRIALS SEVEREBUT HER CONDUCT WAS BLAMELESS YET THE WORLD ADMIRED HER NOT HER SILENT MODEST VIRTUES WERE NOT FORMED TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF THE INJUDICIOUS CROWD AND HER UNDERSTANDING WAS NOT BRILLIANT ENOUGH TO EXCITE ADMIRATION BUT SHE WAS REGARDLESS OF THE OPINION OF THE WORLD SHE SOUGHT HER REWARD IN THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE HER VIRTUE WAS DERIVEDAND SHE FOUND IT HE WHO FOR WISE AND MERCIFUL PURPOSES SUFFERED HER TO BE AFFLICTED SUPPORTED HER UNDER HER TRIALS THEREBY CALLING FORTH THE EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES WITH WHICH HE HAD ADORNED HER GENTLE SOUL AND IMPARTING TO HER A DEGREE OF HEARTFELT COMFORT WHICH NO EARTHLY BLESSING COULD AFFORD THIS AMIABLE PARENT DIED WHEN ANNA WAS NEAR EIGHTEEN AND LEFT HER TO THE CARE OF HER FATHER WHOSE HIGH SPIRIT SHE HAD IMBIBED HOWEVER THE RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES WHICH HER MOTHER HAD INSTILLED REGULATED HER NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND SO ELEVATED HER CHARACTER THAT HER HEART WAS REGULATED BY HER UNDERSTANDING HER FATHER WHO HAD INSENSIBLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN DEBT AFTER HER MOTHERS DEATH TRIED MANY DIFFERENT SCHEMES OF LIFE ALL OF WHICH AT FIRST WORE A PROMISING ASPECT BUT WANTING THAT SUPPLENESS OF TEMPER THAT ENABLES PEOPLE TO RISE IN

COURTED HIS AFFAIRS WERE AT LAST IN SUCH A DESPERATE STATE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED RELUCTANTLY TO ACCEPT OF AN INVITATION FROM HIS BROTHER WHO WITH HIS WIFE A WEAK FINE LADY INTENDED TO SPEND SOME TIME ON THE CONTINENT HIS DAUGHTER WAS OF COURSE TO BE OF THE PARTY THE RESTRAINT OF OBLIGATIONS DID NOT SUIT HIS TEMPER AND FEELING HIMSELF DEPENDENT HE IMAGINED EVERY ONE MEANT TO INSULT HIM SOME SARCASMS WERE THROWN OUT ONE DAY BY A GENTLEMAN IN A LARGE COMPANY THEY WERE NOT PERSONAL YET HE TOOK FIRE HIS SORE MIND WAS EASILY HURT HE RESENTED THEM AND HEATED BY WINE THEY BOTH SAID MORE THAN THEIR COOL REASON WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED MR LOFTY IMAGINED HIS HONOUR WAS WOUNDED AND THE NEXT MORNING SENT HIM A CHALLENGE THEY METAND HE KILLED HIS ANTAGONIST WHO DYING PARDONED HIM AND DECLARED THAT THE SENTIMENTS WHICH HAD GIVEN HIM SO MUCH OFFENCE FELL FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT AND WERE NOT LEVELLED AT ANY PERSON THE DYING MAN LAMENTED THAT THE THREAD OF A THOUGHTLESS LIFE HAD BEEN SO SUDDENLY
